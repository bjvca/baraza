Community based monitoring and public service delivery - Impact, and the
 role of information, deliberation, and jurisdictional tier
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
To improve public service delivery, the Government of Uganda organizes community
 forums—popularly known as barazas—where citizens receive information from
 government officials, and get the opportunity to directly engage with them.
 We designed a cluster randomized control trial to assess the impact of
 this policy intervention on public service delivery in agriculture, health,
 education, and infrastructure.
 we find no impact of the intervention on general public service delivery,
 but there are some indications that sub-county level barazas increase outcomes
 in the agricultural sector.
 A more exploratory analysis of heterogeneous treatment effects suggests
 a range of localized impacts of barazas.

In 2015, we designed a study aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of community
 based monitoring and accountability fora in Uganda
\emph on
.

\emph default
 The baraza programme, an initiative of the president of Uganda and implemented
 by the Office of the Prime Minister (OPM), was designed to improve public
 service delivery by enhancing public involvement in holding the government
 accountable for service delivery in relation to resources spent 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "New1"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 In addition to establishing, in a rigorous way, if the program had an impact
 on public service delivery and associated outcomes, the study also sought
 to inform policy makers about the relative effectiveness of barazas organized
 at lower administrative levels (the sub-county) to that of barazas organized
 at a more aggregate level (the district).
 A third objective of the study was to assess the relative importance of
 the two main components of a generic baraza event: using a two-by-two factorial
 design, it differentiated between, on the one hand, the impact of providing
 citizens with information related to budgeting and spending and planning,
 and, on the other hand, the impact of allowing citizens to engage with
 public servants and politicians in moderated questions-and-answers sessions.
 Towards the end of 2015, a baseline survey involving more than 12,500 household
s and 400 government officials was conducted.
 After completion of the baseline, we trained local government officials
 and community leaders to ensure adherence to the intervention protocols,
 and the interventions were rolled out by the OPM.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the study was initially assumed to take about 2 years, OPM faced various
 challenges that affected the timely roll-out of the intervention, including
 budgetary constraints and disruptions related to the general elections
 of 2016.
 Four years after the baseline survey, with about 50 percent of the planned
 interventions completed, a trade-off needed to be made between waiting
 for the remaining barazas to be completed or conducting the end-line after
 partial roll-out.
 It was decided to proceed with end-line data collection and employ various
 strategies to diagnose, and control for, potential selection bias that
 may have been introduced by the partial roll-out.
 Early 2020, endline data was collected on 6,700 households and 260 government
 officials.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A confirmatory analysis strictly adhering to a pre-registered pre-analysis
 plan that summarizes a range of outcomes into four different families of
 outcomes corresponding to the main sectors—agriculture, infrastructure,
 health and education—and one overall index shows little evidence that the
 baraza intervention had an impact on public service delivery or its associated
 outcomes.
 The only exception is service delivery in the agricultural sector, where
 we find that sub-county level barazas had a positive impact, and that this
 impact is clearly larger than the (lack of) impact associated with district
 level barazas.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a more exploratory analysis, we first look at various outcomes in each
 of the four sectors in more detail.
 We then look for changes in behavior that was explicitly targeted by the
 intervention, such as information seeking behavior and contributions to
 the common good.
 Finally, we provide results on changes in the perception of citizens on
 a range of problems that came up in discussions with stakeholders during
 qualitative fieldwork.
 We also explore heterogeneity in the treatment effects arising from differences
 in timing of the intervention, political connections of the sub-counties,
 baseline levels of elite capture, ethnic fractionalization, and distance
 of the household to the sub-county headquarters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The exploratory analysis adds nuance to the conclusion arrived at in the
 confirmatory part.
 The sector level aggregate outcomes hide significant impacts on access
 to drinking water and schooling infrastructure.
 But there are also signs that the aggregate treatment effects mask significant
 heterogeneity.
 For instance, the impact of sub-county barazas on access to extension seemed
 to be driven particularly by households that live close to the sub-county
 headquarters.
 The deliberative component of the baraza seemed to increase service delivery
 in the area of infrastructure and reduced distance to the nearest public
 health facility, particularly if the sub-county had political connections.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are several studies that looked at the impact of community based monitorin
g on public service delivery, many of them using Uganda as a case.
 A landmark study is 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "bjorkman2009power"

\end_inset

, who analyzed the impact of a community driven local accountability project
 in primary health care provision in Uganda.
 They found that the intervention resulted in significant improvements in
 health care delivery, utilization, and health outcomes (most notably child
 mortality and weight-for-age z-scores) after one year, and confirmed in
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "bjorkman2017experimental"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 that these effects also hold in the longer run.
 More recently, however, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "raffler2018weakness"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 came to different conclusions when testing an intervention closely modeled
 on the one of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "bjorkman2009power"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 and in a similar setting.
 The study, involving a three wave panel of more than 14,000 households
 and a factorial design to break down the intervention into its two most
 important components similar to what we used, showed that the intervention
 was able to change the behavior of public service providers.
 However, it did not find that the intervention directly increased community
 monitoring, nor generated improvements in health outcomes, at least in
 the short run.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our study contributes to this literature in various ways.
 First, this study is one of few that considers the role of jurisdictional
 tier on the effectiveness of community based monitoring.
 The level at which the meetings are organized may affect its effectiveness
 in potentially opposing directions.
 Interventions at a more local level may result in more relevant issues
 being scrutinized.
 However, qualitative explorations suggest that, often, issues raised in
 lower level barazas were beyond the operational jurisdiction of the officials
 that were present at the baraza 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "van2018impact"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 This may be less of a problem when barazas are organized at district level.
 Most other studies consider interventions that were placed at fairly local
 jurisdictional levels.
 For instance, the intervention in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "raffler2018weakness"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 was implemented in health centers and their associated catchment areas,
 defined as the three villages closest to the health center.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Second, our study evaluated the impact of a large scale, high profile policy
 intervention that receives broad support within government, among opinion
 leaders and among citizens in Uganda.
 Such interventions may instigate an entirely different set of dynamics
 than interventions that are organized by local or international NGOs (as
 is the case in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "bjorkman2009power"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "raffler2018weakness"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 For instance, many of the actors involved may find that NGOs are not mandated
 when it comes to public services such as health and education.
 This is also consistent with suggestive evidence in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "raffler2018weakness"
literal "true"

\end_inset

, who found that the presence of sub-county officials during their community
 based monitoring intervention boosted the impact of the intervention.
 However, effects may also work in the opposite direction.
 For example, an intervention to reduce absenteeism in government public
 health facilities in India was initially very successful, but ceased to
 have any impact after the local bureaucracy started providing official
 excuses for most of the nurses’ absences 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "10.1162/JEEA.2008.6.2-3.487"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 Most of the other studies that are closest to our study use NGOs as implementin
g partners .
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Third, baraza's take a comprehensive, multi-sector approach, enabling cross-sect
oral planning and potentially allowing for re-allocation of resources across
 sectors to better align problems that were identified during barazas.
 Some of the problems most mentioned by users, such hygiene in health centers
 or accessibility, involve cooperation between heads of different sectors
 (eg.
 health and infrastructure to get access to water in health centers).
 Bringing sector heads together and confronting them with the priorities
 of citizens may increase information sharing and cooperation between them.
 Most other studies focus on a single sector.
 Health in particular seems to be a popular sector for community monitoring
 interventions

The paper starts with providing some background on the baraza intervention,
 followed by a section that sets out the objectives of the study.
 We then present the experimental design and describe the treatments.
 Next is a section on the implementation challenges, the implications of
 this for the study, and the strategies used to test and deal with it.
 The following section presents results, starting with the overall and sector
 level impact based in outcome indices that closely follows the pre-analysis
 plan and a pre-registered report.
 This is followed by a section the provides a more detailed analysis for
 outcomes within each sector.
 We also explore some of the assumed impact pathways, and investigate treatment
 heterogeneity in a separate section.
 The last section concludes.

\begin_layout Standard
In the mid-1980s, after attaining relative stability, the Government of
 Uganda, supported by development partners, initiated far reaching liberalizatio
n efforts and introduced a decentralized system of governance 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "francis2003balancing"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 Decentralization was considered a suitable mechanism for improving efficiency,
 effectiveness and inclusiveness of public service delivery.
 It was assumed it would lead to the formulation of services that are more
 aligned to citizens' needs and bring representative governance closer to
 citizens.
 However, in order to work, decentralization requires citizens to actively
 participate in planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of developme
nt interventions in their locations.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Until recently, this

 component was lacking in Uganda’s decentralization process.
 As a result, the realization of benefits of decentralization in Uganda
 has been greatly affected by misaligned priorities, substandard services,
 elite capture, ineffective monitoring and weak accountability 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "bjorkman2009power,reinikka2004local"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 In response to this, the Government of Uganda, under the stewardship of
 the Office of the Prime Minister (OPM), initiated community based monitoring
 and accountability fora (or citizen barazas) in 2009 with the general objective
 of “enhancing public involvement in holding the government accountable
 for service delivery in relation to the resources spent”

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Barazas were conceived as platforms for enhancing information sharing between
 policy makers (the client), public servants (the implementer), and beneficiarie
s of public goods and services (the users).
 In addition, barazas were designed to provide the opportunity to users
 to ask questions to the policy makers and public service providers, and
 deliberate among themselves.
 It is expected that, ultimately, barazas will contribute to participatory
 planning and effective monitoring, and increase accountability and transparency
 among all stakeholders.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Barazas were first piloted in the financial year 2009/10.
 Since then, efforts have been underway to roll out barazas in all sub-counties
 in the country.
 During the full-scale implementation phase in the financial year 2010/2011,
 16 more sub-counties in 8 districts had held a baraza event.
 And, by the last quarter of 2011/2012, 267 out of the country’s total of
 1,340 sub-counties, spread over 112 districts, had held a baraza meeting.
 At the beginning of the 2012/2013 financial year, however, changes in implement
ation were suggested: subsequent barazas would target districts instead
 of sub-counties to increase participation at a higher jurisdictional levels
 and reduce costs.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A typical baraza is initiated from the center, with the OPM mobilizing district
 and sub-county officials.
 These include the Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) as the head of public
 service providers at the district level, the Resident District Commissioner
 (RDC) as a direct representative of the president, the District Local Council
 Chairperson (LC5) as the representative of political leadership at the
 district level, and the various sector heads responsible for public services
 in each sector (agriculture, education, infrastructure and health).
 For sub-county level barazas, the sub-county level equivalents of the CAO
 (the sub-county chief) and the LC5 (the sub-county chairperson, or LC3)
 also have important roles.
 OPM, in consultation with the district leaders (RDC, CAO and the LC5) and
 other stakeholders, agree on the date and a neutral location.
 Again, in consultation with the district leaders, viable moderators are
 identified to guide the baraza forum.
 Village mobilizers and community resource persons are used to publicize
 the event.
 These community mobilization efforts are further reinforced by adverts
 in the local media in the form of radio announcements, printed banners,
 posters and fliers, and mobile public address systems, a few days before
 the baraza event.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The baraza meeting itself is chaired by the Office of the RDC in each district.
 In front of the audience, including local citizens, invited opinion leaders,
 elders, and journalists, the moderators seek feedback from each head of
 major sectors.
 Sector heads are required to present what services were planned to be delivered
 in the sub-county, what was actually delivered and in what quantity and
 quality, and what issues and challenges have emerged and what is the way
 forward.
 The moderators then seek feedback from citizens on whether what has been
 presented is what they understand was planned for and actually implemented
 in different locations.
 Sector heads are then given another opportunity to clarify on, or react
 to, any issues raised by the citizens.
 At the end of the process, a report to the OPM is prepared, indicating
 issues that arose in the baraza meeting.
 This report particularly points out policy and program implementation weaknesse
s and challenges, which is then expected to further feed into the general
 government performance management system.
 Usually, a minister of state is also present at the baraza.
 Baraza events often become very emotional and the events attract considerable
 media attention, also from the national newspapers.

The impact of (sub-county level) barazas
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The baraza intervention as conceived by the OPM is a fairly standard community
 based monitoring intervention that combines the provision of information
 with the possibility of citizens to engage with each other and with decision
 makers at a fairly local level.
 Such community based monitoring has become a popular tool to increase service
 delivery.
 However, not all such interventions appear to be successful 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "olken2007monitoring"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 A first question is therefore simply related to the impact of a typical
 baraza intervention as originally conceived and organized by OPM.
 In particular, we will test the impact of sub-county level barazas that
 combine information provision with a deliberation component on public service
 delivery and associated outcomes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The information mechanism
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The relationship between citizens and government officials is reminiscent
 of the principal–agent problem.
 In essence, there are three players (elected politicians, civil servants
 and citizens) with only partly overlapping information sets and potentially
 competing interests
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
As the public servant must be responsive to the needs of both the client
 and the community at the same time, the problem can be characterized as
 a multiple or common agency problem, which adds a collective action component
 to the standard principle-agent problem

\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Bringing stakeholders together in town hall type meetings is assumed to
 reduce information asymmetries, and may be an effective way to increase
 the quality of public service delivery by (1) allowing citizens to monitor
 and apply bottom-up pressure on under-performing civil servants and (2)
 increase top-down pressure on under-performing civil servants by revealing
 to politicians the discrepancy between what was promised and actual performance.
 A second central question in this study therefore relates to the relative
 importance of the information provision component within the broader baraza
 intervention.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is some evidence that channeling of information to citizens about
 the quantity, modality, and quality of public services, as well as about
 the investments and policy decisions made by politicians, bureaucrats,
 and service providers can increase the ability of the users to hold the
 leaders accountable and improve service provision.
 For example, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "doi:10.1080/09645290903157484"

\end_inset

 established, using a field experiment in India, that community information
 campaigns about states’ school management obligations had a positive impact
 on school performance.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "grossman2018information"

\end_inset

 disseminated information about job performance for randomly selected Ugandan
 politicians.
 While this increased job performance for the politicians on a range of
 criteria, they found no impact on public service provision.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 found that targeted information reduced elite capture in Indonesia: mailing
 cards with program information to targeted beneficiaries increased the
 subsidy they received from a subsidized rice program.
 A recent review of 48 empirical studies on the impacts of information on
 governance and service delivery also suggests that the availability of
 information alone may not suffice.
 Information must be deemed relevant to its recipient, and individuals must
 have both power and incentives to act on the information 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "KOSEC2020104376"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The information component may also be important in managing expectations
 of the client.
 Citizens may have exaggerated beliefs about the resources at the disposal
 of decision makers and service providers, or they may not fully appreciate
 the challenges civil service providers face when doing their job.
 For instance, during focus group discussions, service providers mentioned
 that citizens sometime blame officials for things they have no control
 over.
 More in general, information may help sensitize citizens about the role
 of public service provision (for example, making sure boreholes are present)
 but that there are also limits to what citizens can expect (for instance,
 citizens are still required to boil water).
 When information can rectify inflated expectations, we may not find changes
 in the quantity or quality of public services, but we may still find changes
 in citizens' perceptions about the quality of these services.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The deliberation mechanism
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are various ways in which deliberation may increase the quality of
 public service delivery.
 First, it has a legitimizing effect on decisions arrived at in this fashion.
 Effective deliberation assumes equal voice of the arguments of both marginal
 and advantaged agents, and the role of evidence that support the positions
 articulated.
 Second, deliberation can more effectively distill social choice than simple
 voting and majoritarian rule, in part by building consensus both among
 citizens and between public servants and citizens.
 Third, deliberation has been found to positively impact the vigor and breadth
 of subsequent citizen involvement in community affairs 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "bjorkman2017experimental"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Deliberation may also affect information flows.
 In a baraza, the information component is primarily designed to inform
 citizens about the activities of the service providers.
 To some extent, citizens are passive recipients of this information, and
 officials report what they consider relevant, or may even attempt to misreprese
nt the facts.
 If citizens are able to engage with policy makers and civil servants, they
 may request particular information that is relevant to them.
 It may also result in information flows in the opposite direction as government
 officials learn about priorities and concerns of the citizens.
 The third key question is thus about the relative importance of the deliberatio
n aspect of a typical baraza.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Impacts of deliberative processes have also been the subject of empirical
 analysis.
 For example, in addition to increasing community participation mentioned
 above, experimental evidence also shows that deliberative processes make
 decision outcomes less sensitive to the institution (e.g.
 voting) rules that bring them about

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Jurisdictional tier
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The baraza intervention can also be distinguished by the administrative
 level at which it is implemented.
 Barazas were originally implemented at the sub-county level but from 2012
 onward, more and more barazas were implemented at the district level
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
An average district consists of about 15 to 20 sub-counties.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 This administrative placement dimension immediately points to a potential
 trade-off between attempting to achieve breadth of coverage (through district-l
evel barazas), and depth of coverage (through sub-county-level barazas).
 While conducting a district-level baraza may be cheaper than conducting
 sub-county-level barazas in all sub-counties of that district, it is not
 clear a-priori how these cost savings justify potential reduction in effectiven
ess of district-level barazas in any given sub-county of the concerned district.
 Therefore, a final objective of this study is to assess the impact of district
 level barazas, and compare this to the effectiveness of barazas organized
 that the lower sub-county level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Which is more effective, placement at a higher or lower level, will likely
 depend on the outcome and context.
 For instance, it has been argued that engaging small groups can be more
 effective because they can be coordinated more easily, but large groups
 may make more sense if the desired outcome would be enjoyed by a broader
 group 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "donato2016power"

\end_inset

.
 Furthermore, action may be more likely if an issue is brought by a large
 group instead of a small group of people complaining about a highly localized
 issue 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "banerjee2004wealth"

 It may also be that issues highlighted at a local level fall under the
 responsibility of higher level authorities and vice versa.

\begin_layout Section
Experimental design
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To answer the above questions, we designed a social experiment covering
 districts, sub-counties, and households across the four regional blocks
 (Northern, Western, Central and Eastern) of Uganda.
 Each regional block has somewhat unique characteristics in terms of ethnicity,
 geographical and agro-ecological conditions, as well as cultural history.
 As noted in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Background-of-the"

\end_inset

, a small share of sub-counties, albeit located throughout all of Uganda’s
 112 districts across the four regions, had already received a sub-county
 level baraza intervention prior to the study.
 We thus selected our sample of districts from ‘eligible districts’, and
 our sample of sub-counties from ‘eligible sub-counties’.
 An ‘eligible district’ was defined as a district in which a district level
 baraza was not already implemented prior to the start of the study.
 An ‘eligible sub-county’ was defined as a sub-county to which two conditions
 applied: (i) a sub-county level baraza had not yet taken place, and (ii)
 the sub-county was in an ‘eligible district’.
 Preliminary analysis of the baraza implementation data at the time of the
 start of the study indicated that there were minimum 20 eligible districts
 per region, and a total of 94 eligible districts.
 In each region, there were at least 147 sub-counties that had never been
 treated and were in eligible districts; the total of eligible sub-counties
 was about 720

The fact we restrict ourselves to eligible districts and sub-counties in
 this way has obvious consequences for the study population.
 For instance, the three districts that together constitute Karamoja, one
 of the poorest and most remote areas located in the northeast of Uganda,
 had already received district level barazas.
 As a result, this area was excluded from the analysis.
 While the impact evaluation had national coverage, this fact that we were
 evaluating and ongoing policy project needs to be kept in mind when interpretin
g results and extrapolating conclusions.

This study employed a two-step randomization design, illustrated in Figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
 In a first step, we randomly allocate eligible districts to treatment and
 control conditions.
 In particular, some of the eligible districts start receiving district
 level barazas 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(D^{ID}\right)$
\end_inset

, while other districts do not receive a baraza at this level 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(D^{0}\right)$

As will be explained in detail below, we do not differentiate between the
 information component and the deliberation component of barazas organized
 at the district level.
 As such, they are the district level equivalent of sub-county level barazas
 that combines both information and deliberation treatment.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 In a second step, we proceed with all eligible sub-counties and randomly
 allocate each sub-county to one of four conditions in a 2 by 2 factorial
 design.
 In particular, about one quarter of all eligible sub-counties sampled from
 
\begin_inset Formula $D^{0}$
\end_inset

 will serve as pure control and will not receive any baraza at any level
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(S_{0}^{0}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 About one quarter will receive a sub-county level baraza that combines
 both information and deliberation treatment 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(S_{ID}^{0}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 One quarter will receive a sub-county level baraza that consists of officials
 providing information and limited opportunity for citizens to engage 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(S_{I}^{0}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 One quarter will receive a sub-county level baraza with a focus on citizens
 engaging with each other and with officials, with limited information provision
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(S_{D}^{0}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 We also take a random sample of sub-counties from the 
\begin_inset Formula $D^{ID}$
\end_inset

 districts that received the district level baraza 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(S_{0}^{ID}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Within each sub-county, we sample a fixed number of households.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above design allows us to answer the four research questions in Section
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Design-features:-administrative"

\end_inset

.
 First, to assess the impact of the sub-county baraza interventions as implement
ed by the government of Uganda, one can compare outcomes of households that
 were sampled from 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{ID}^{0}$
\end_inset

 to outcomes of households that were sampled from 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{0}^{0}$
\end_inset

.
 Second, to assess the relative importance of the information component
 of a baraza, one can compare outcomes of all households that were exposed
 to the information component (either as a stand alone information baraza
 as implemented in 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{I}^{0}$
\end_inset

 or as part of a combined baraza as implemented in 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{ID}^{0}$
\end_inset

) to outcomes of all households that were not exposed to the information
 component of the baraza (either because they did not receive a baraza at
 all 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(S_{0}^{0}\right)$
\end_inset

 or because they only received a deliberation focused baraza 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(S_{D}^{0}\right)$
\end_inset

).
 Similarly, to assess the relative importance of the deliberation component
 of a baraza, one can compare outcomes of all households that were exposed
 to the deliberation component (either as a stand alone deliberation baraza
 as implemented in 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{D}^{0}$
\end_inset

 or as part of a combined baraza as implemented in 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{ID}^{0}$
\end_inset

) to outcomes of all households that were not exposed to the information
 component of the baraza (either because they did not receive a baraza at
 all 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(S_{0}^{0}\right)$
\end_inset

 or because they only received an information baraza 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(S_{I}^{0}\right)$
\end_inset

).
 Note that, due to the factorial design, much more information can be used
 to test the second and third hypotheses than the first hypothesis.
 Finally, to investigate administrative placement of the intervention, two
 comparisons will be used.
 First, and similar to the first hypothesis, we can simply estimate the
 impact of district level barazas by comparing outcomes of households that
 were sampled from 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{0}^{ID}$
\end_inset

 to households that were sampled from 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{0}^{0}$
\end_inset

.
 However, we can also directly compare district level barazas to sub-county
 level barazas by comparing outcomes of households that were sampled from
 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{0}^{ID}$
\end_inset

 to outcomes of household that were sampled from 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{ID}^{0}$
\end_inset

\begin_layout Plain Layout
From a policy perspective, in light of the shift from sub-county level barazas
 to district level barazas from 2012 onward, the last comparison is the
 most interesting one, and this comparison was pre-registered.
 However, the partial roll-out of the intervention means that for this compariso
n we are constrained by the number of sub-counties in 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{ID}^{0}$
\end_inset

 that ended up being treated.
 Comparisons of outcomes in areas that received a district level baraza
 treatment to areas that did not receive a baraza have more statistical
 power because more observations can be used.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To determine the number of districts, sub-counties and households to include
 in the study, we ran an extensive series of power calculations that used
 data from the Uganda National Household Survey of 2009/10 and the Demographic
 and Health Survey of 2011 to estimate standard errors of the outcomes and
 inter-class correlations.
 Outcomes used to determine sample size included weight-for-age z-scores
 for children; number of days unable to work as percentage of days sick
 at the household level; number of years the average child within the household
 goes to school, proportion of children in the household currently attending
 school; the proportion of households that was visited by an extension worker
 in the previous year; maize yields; time to get drinking water (including
 waiting time); and share of households having access to improved drinking
 water sources.
 This resulted in the selection of a total sample size of 11,500 households
 distributed over 230 sub-counties in 40 districts throughout Uganda, on
 which baseline data was collected.

Treatments
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The treatments were based on the baraza intervention as designed and implemented
 by the government before the start of the study.
 A description of a generic sub-county level baraza was already given in
 Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Background-of-the"

\end_inset

.
 From such a generic baraza, we either removed the information component
 or the deliberation component to test the relative importance of these
 components.
 To standardize the treatments, we developed detailed scripts that RDCs
 and facilitators were expected to follow.
 Furthermore, manuals for RDCs and facilitators were developed, and all
 were invited for a training.
 We will summarize the main differences between an information baraza and
 a deliberation baraza here.
 Detailed information can be found in

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For information (and combined information and deliberation) barazas, templates
 to gather information were developed to be filled by officials and mounted
 at a central location in each parish of the sub-county (or the district
 in case of a district level baraza) two weeks before the baraza event was
 scheduled to take place.
 The template was designed to inform citizens about planned and actual public
 expenditures for the previous fiscal year, about achievements and challenges
 encountered during that year, and about planned expenditures and targets
 for the next fiscal year.
 This information needed to be provided for each of the four sectors (agricultur
e, infrastructure, health and education) by the sub-county chief.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
While the preparation and distribution of these posters were the responsibility
 of the RDC, we had research assistants that closely monitored the implementatio
n of this.
 We also assisted in printing of the template posters.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 On the day of the baraza event, the CAO was expected to give a brief presentati
on on the overall budget for the fiscal year, the main achievements and
 challenges in service delivery, and to introduce sector heads.
 After a brief intervention by the OPM, officials responsible for each sector
 then present more or less the same as what was required for the templates.
 An information-focused baraza allowed for only 10 clarifying questions
 to be asked, to be collected and asked by the facilitator.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the deliberation barazas, posters were also mounted in each parish of
 the sub-county, but only to announce that a baraza was going to be held
 at a particular date and place.
 At the baraza itself, after a brief introduction by the OPM, citizens were
 instructed to break into 4 groups by sector, discuss problems they faced
 and draw up a list of priority issues that needed to be addressed.
 Facilitators in each group were required to anonymously collect these issues
 and concerns.
 Facilitators were expected to focus the discussion on what was done well,
 and on problems encountered during the past year.
 The discussions should also result in agreement on what should be done
 in the next fiscal year.
 After the break-out sessions, officials were asked to react to the specific
 comments and requests.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A sub-county level baraza in the crossed treatment group simply combined
 both elements.
 District level baraza were very similar to sub-county level barazas, except
 for the fact that district level barazas were organized at the district
 headquarters, all sub-county chiefs and LC3's of each sub-county were expected
 to attend in case questions arise related to their sub-county, and all
 citizens within the entire district were invited.

\begin_layout Standard
The implementer of the baraza project, the OPM, experienced significant
 challenges in the roll-out of the intervention, affecting sub-county level
 barazas in particular.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
All district level barazas were implemented as planned, so we mainly focus
 on sub-county level barazas here.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 At the start of 2018, and almost two and a half years after baseline data
 was collected, only about 25 percent of the planned sub-county level interventi
ons had happened.
 At that point, costs and benefits of waiting until OPM finished all sub-county
 barazas or collecting baseline information after incomplete roll-out were
 assessed and various scenarios and strategies were evaluated
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
One such strategy was a staggered endline data collections strategy, whereby
 endline data would be collected in areas where a baraza took place early
 in the project while we waited for the remaining barazas to be rolled out.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 After an additional six months, with still only 56 out of the 155 sub-county
 barazas implemented, it appeared that the best scenario would be one whereby
 end-line data would be collected before all sub-counties were treated,
 given that the governments financial constraints made it unlikely that
 complete roll-out would take place any time soon.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
End-line data collection after partial roll-out may introduce selection
 bias in the sub-sample of sub-counties that were assigned to the treatment.
 It may be that, from the randomly assigned treatment sub-counties, particular
 sub-counties were selected to be treated first and others postponed.
 For instance, for logistical reasons, the implementing partner may have
 started with sub-counties that were close to the capital, resulting in
 a treatment group that would not be directly comparable to the control
 group.
 Or the OPM may decide to prioritize sub-counties that perform worse on
 certain indicators they have access to, such as number of boreholes or
 student enrollment rates.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We acknowledge that the partial roll-out is a threat to internal validity
 that should not be ignored.
 At the same time, the fact that we started from a cluster randomized control
 design still provides a substantial advantage over studies that are based
 on observational data.
 For instance, potential selection emanating from partial roll-out is restricted
 to the sub-sample of sub-counties that were assigned to be treated group
 only, significantly reducing the scope for bias.
 In addition, the list of sub-counties to be treated that we shared with
 the implementing partner was organized by treatment group (information,
 deliberation and combined treatment), and in each treatment group, sub-counties
 were listed alphabetically.
 Looking at the list in light of the partial roll-out, we get the impression
 that the OPM started at the top of the list and worked their way down.
 As a result, relatively more sub-counties that were assigned the information
 treatment were treated, and sub-counties toward the top of the list are
 also more likely to be treated.
 This pattern is confirmed when regressing the likelihood of being treated
 on the rank of the sub-county.
 This also suggests that OPM officials did not deliberately select certain
 sub-counties.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Below, we report on additional strategies used to diagnose potential selection
 bias and explain our endline data collection strategy aimed at reducing
 potential selection bias resulting from the partial roll-out.
 We also reflect on the fact that the partial roll-out also affects statistical
 power and simulate minimal detectable effect sizes at different power levels
 for the new reduces sample size associated with the partial roll-out.

Balance between planned-to-treat-but-not-treated sub-counties, and control
 sub-counties
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One way to test if selection bias was introduced by the partial roll-out
 is by comparing outcomes in control sub-counties to outcomes in sub-counties
 that were allocated to receive treatment but did not end up receiving treatment.
 The idea is that if the roll-out was random, sub-counties that were allocated
 randomly to a particular treatment at the design stage but did not end
 up receiving treatment can be interchanged with sub-counties that were
 randomly selected at design stage to function as control sub-counties.
 Finding no significant differences in outcomes between these two groups
 would support the hypothesis that the partial roll-out did not introduce
 selection bias.
 If the incomplete roll-out introduced selection bias, comparing these two
 groups may also be informative to assess the direction and magnitude of
 the bias.
 Note that such comparisons can be done using baseline data, but may be
 particularly informative after endline data collection.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
An alternative comparison would be to restrict attention to the treatment
 group and look at differences between baseline characteristics of sub-counties
 that ended up being treatment and those that did not.
 However, such a comparison will have fewer observations and can not be
 done at endline.

\begin_layout Standard
Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Balance_planed_ctrl"

\end_inset

 presents a table with, for each of the three treatment arms affected by
 the partial roll-out, differences in average outcomes of planned but not
 treated sub-counties and planned control sub-counties (the first column
 also reports sample means).
 It is essentially the same table as the the original balance table (Table
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:balance_orig"

\end_inset

), but after dropping sub-counties that were treated.
 We find that the imbalance related to distance to nearest all weather road
 found in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:balance_orig"

\end_inset

 becomes even more pronounced.
 This may indicate that OPM prioritized treatment of less remote areas.
 Similarly, for the information baraza, the imbalance for the number of
 children in school becomes stronger, suggesting information barazas were
 organized in areas where fewer children went to school to begin with.
 At the same time, it should be noted that significant differences are only
 found for comparison on which balance was rejected in the original balance
 table.
 Judged by the baseline characteristics used in the original balance table,
 the incomplete roll-out did not increase imbalance; in fact, it may have
 actually improved balance (see also Table

 summarizes the factorial design that underlies the sub-county level baraza
 impact evaluation.
 It shows that, based on the original power calculations, we planned to
 have between 51 and 53 in each treatment cell.
 At the start of the endline data collection, 29 sub-counties of the 51
 that were supposed to receive the information-only treatment were treated,
 18 sub-counties of the 51 that were supposed to receive the deliberation-only
 treatment were treated, and 20 sub-counties of the 53 that were supposed
 to receive the crossed (information + deliberation) treatment were treated.
 All of the 8 districts that were supposed to be treated were treated, from
 which 40 sub-counties were sampled.
 Overall, this means that about 55 percent of the sub-counties that needed
 to receive any form of baraza, received the treatment.

As only part of the intervention was implemented, it may not be cost effective
 to collect end-line data on all sub-counties that did not receive a treatment
 (either because they were allocated to the control or because they ended
 up not being treated).
 Statistical power is optimal when the number of treatment units is equal
 to the number of control units, and while adding more control sub-counties
 will increase power, the gains in power have the be weighed against the
 cost of collecting additional endline data.
 We decided to collect endline data on 40 control sub-counties, which is
 equal to the number of sub-counties that was treated with a district level
 baraza.
 This raises the question: from the potential control sub-counties (either
 those that were allocated to the control or because they ended up not being
 treated), which control sub-counties should be included in the endline
 data collection? One reasonable suggestion would be to pick them randomly.
 However, if the roll-out was not random, such a strategy may lead to a
 biased estimate of the causal impact of the intervention.
 For instance, if the OPM prioritized treatment of less remote areas, randomly
 selecting control sub-counties may result in a sample in which sub-counties
 in less remote locations are relatively under-represented and sub-counties
 that are in more remote areas relatively over-represented in the control
 group.
 A better strategy may be to match each treated sub-county to a control
 sub-county that is similar in a range of observable pre-treatment characteristi
cs that the planner had access to when rolling out the intervention and
 are likely to have affected his or her decision 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 For instance, a sub-county that has been treated may be matched to a candidate
 untreated sub-county that is in the same area (based on GPS coordinates
 of the sub-county headquarters).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We used a range of sub-county characteristics that were likely to be known
 to the planner and may have affected how the intervention was rolled out
 to match each treated sub-county to a control sub-county that was similar
 in terms of these characteristics.
 More in particular, we match on the following characteristics that were
 obtained at baseline from a survey of village chairs and chief administrative
 officers (CAO) of each sub-county: geographic location of the sub-county
 using GPS coordinates of the headquarters, road infrastructure within the
 sub-county (km tarmac road and km all-weather (gravel) road), share of
 households with electricity, share of households with an iron roof or tiles,
 number of health centers in the sub-county, female primary school dropout
 rate, number of Universal Primary Education (UPE) schools in the sub-county,
 percent of farmers that use improved seed, and political connections of
 the sub-county (defined by having a minister or member of parliament coming
 from the sub-county).
 These characteristics are used in a probit regression to predict the probabilit
y that a sub-county would be treated.
 The probabilities are then used to match the each treated sub-county to
 a candidate control sub-county that is closest in terms of the predicted
 probability of being treated.

In section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Balance-between-planned-to-treat"

\end_inset

, we diagnosed potential selection bias introduced by the partial roll-out
 by comparing baseline characteristics of planned treatment sub-counties
 that ended up not being treated to that of control sub-counties.
 To enable similar comparisons using endline data, we need to make sure
 we have data on a sufficient number of planned treatment sub-counties that
 ended up not being treated to enable comparisons similar to those reported
 in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Balance_planed_ctrl"

\end_inset

.
 As a result, we implemented the matching of treatment and control sub-counties
 in a stratified way.

 The imbalance that was found in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 for the information treatment on household size and the number of children
 in school has disappeared.
 Consistent with the indication that OPM may have prioritized treatment
 of less remote areas (Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Balance_planed_ctrl"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

), we now find that distance to nearest all-weather roads is on average
 slightly higher in control sub-counties.
 Two significant results out of 40 comparison is again what can be expected
 from pure chance alone and so we conclude that also with this new sample
 we maintain balance between treatment and control on a range of baseline
 characteristics for the various comparisons.

While the ex-ante matching strategy may reduce bias resulting from incomplete
 roll-out, there are also costs involved.
 First, if sample selection is introduced by the roll-out, matching may
 further reduce external validity of the study, as now also the control
 sub-counties are not a random sample of the study population anymore.
 Second, the reduction in potential bias for hypotheses related to the sub-count
y level barazas should be traded off against an increase in potential bias
 when testing differences between control and district level barazas.
 As the sub-county level analysis weighed higher in terms of research objectives
, we decided to prioritize the reduction of bias resulting from incomplete
 roll-out at this level.
 However, it should be kept in mind that both of these issues only become
 relevant if significant selection bias was introduced through the partial
 roll-out.

\begin_layout Subsection
Minimal Detectable Effects (MDEs)

The partial roll-out means a reduction in statistical power.
 In this section, we use baseline data to simulate an updated set of minimal
 detectable effects (MDEs) for a selection of the outcomes we will use to
 judge effectiveness of the intervention (the outcomes are described in
 detail in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

) associated with the reduced sample (after partial roll-out and matching
 40 control sub-counties to treated sub-counties).
 In other words, instead of fixing MDE simulating power for different sample
 sizes, we fix sample size and simulate power for different MDEs.
 We use a standard significance level of 0.05 (double sided).
 MDEs are estimated using a simple analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model
 that controls for the outcome at baseline and accounts for the clustered
 nature of the intervention.

Note that the level of clustering depends on the comparison.
 When we look at sub-county level barazas, clustering is at the sub-county
 level.
 For the comparison between district level barazas ans control, clustering
 is at the district level.
\end_layout

 The simulated MDEs can be a useful guide in deciding whether the intervention
 really had no effect, or an effect that was too small to detect given the
 (realized) research design.

 plots MDEs against power for the first outcome variable that will be used
 to assess the impact of barazas on public service delivery in the agricultural
 sector (extension at home, measured as the percentage of households in
 our sample who report that they were visited by an expert in the previous
 year).

 percent of households in our sample reported that they were visited by
 an extension officer in the year before baseline data collection.
 The gray solid line shows the power curve associated with the deliberation
 treatment, comparing 38 sub-counties that received the deliberation treatment
 (18 deliberation only sub-counties plus 20 information+deliberation sub-countie
s corresponding to a total of about 1,900 households) to 69 sub-counties
 that did not receive the deliberation treatment (40 pure control sub-counties
 plus 29 information only barazas, or about 3,450 households).
 The light blue dashed line closely tracks the gray line, and shows power
 for different MDEs for the information component of the baraza intervention.
 Here, we compare about 2,450 households that live in (29+20) sub-counties
 that received an information baraza to about 2,900 households (in 40+18
 sub-counties) that did not receive a sub-county information baraza.
 We also investigate power for the comparison between pure control barazas
 and sub-county level barazas (black dotted line).
 Here we compare about 1,000 households in the 20 sub-counties that received
 the combined information and deliberation treatment to about 2,000 households
 that did not receive any baraza (in the 40 pure control sub-counties).
 Finally, the dark blue dashed line plots power for the comparison between
 about 2,000 households in 40 pure control sub-counties and about 2,000
 households that were exposed to a district level baraza (sampled from 40
 sub-counties in these districts).

Not surprisingly, we have most power for testing the information treatment.
 We see that the power curve hits the 80 percent threshold for the first
 time at an MDE of about 2.5 percentage points.
 The deliberation experiment is similarly powered, and at 80 percent we
 can expect to identify effects of 3 percentage points or more.
 Due to the smaller sample size, it is harder to compare pure control sub-counti
es to sub-county barazas that received the interacted treatment.
 Still, we are able to comfortably identify an increase of 4 percentage
 points.
 Despite a larger sample size available to test the impact of district level
 barazas, we find power to be comparable to that of the sub-county level
 baraza.
 This is due to the clustering at a much more aggregated level.

Attrition
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As more than four years passed between baseline and endline data collection,
 some level of attrition was to be expected.
 Overall, attrition amounted to 8.6 percent.
 Reports from the field indicated that this attrition was due to some villages
 close to the lake shores that were flooded due to heavy rains.
 Two villages in areas populated with land insecure settlers were dropped
 due to security concerns.
 Finally, attrition was generally higher in urban areas, as households that
 were residing in rented properties returned to their villages.
 Table

 in the Appendix shows that attrition is independent of the various intervention
s of the study.

 However, later a coding mistake was found and corrected: For the comparison
 of outcomes between households that received a sub-county level barazas
 and households in the control group, we were reporting the interaction
 effect between information and deliberation instead of the combined information
 and deliberation effect.
 This was corrected on April 2, 2020 in

 The outcomes can be categorized into four broad sectors: agriculture, health,
 education, and infrastructure (drinking water and roads).
 With this report, we thus committed to key outcomes in each sector, and
 combine the outcomes in the four sectors into sector level indices, and
 in a single index.
 Pre-registration and mock reports have been suggested to reduce intentional
 or unintentional selection of specifications and outcome measures that
 yield positive findings, leading to an unreliable body of published research.

Impact is assessed as a simple treatment-control comparison, implemented
 using an ANCOVA model that also controls for the region (as this was used
 for stratification) and the baseline outcome.
 In particular, to estimate the impact of the sub-county level baraza with
 both information and deliberation components, we restrict the sample to
 pure control sub-counties and sub-counties that received the combined informati
on+deliberation baraza (diagonals in Figure

 The graphs are based on indices that are composed of individual outcomes

This method first reconstructs a complete schedule of potential outcomes
 by adding and subtracting the average treatment effect for control and
 treated units respectively.
 These potential outcomes are then used to simulate all possible random
 allocations.
 For each allocation, average treatment effects are estimated and 2.5th and
 97.5th percentiles are then taken as the lower and upper limits of the 95
 percent confidence interval.
 As this provides a conservative estimate of the confidence interval, it
 may be that results in the graph appear insignificant, but do show up as
 significant when testing significance using Fisher's exact test.

 We also combine the four indices into one overall index that assesses the
 impact on public service delivery in general.
 We find no significant impact of the baraza programme on overall public
 service delivery.
 There are some indications that sub-county level baraza did make a difference
 in the agricultural sector.

The indices combine various outcomes, some of which the expected direction
 of the effect is unclear a-priori.
 For instance, an information baraza may increase the quality of services
 in a hospital or health centre when judged by an objective measure such
 as waiting time.
 However, the information may also result in higher expectations from the
 part of the user.
 As such, perceptions of quality may have reduced as a result of an information
 baraza.
 It is therefore also interesting to look beyond the indices and consider
 outcomes individually.

Agriculture

We first zoom in on the outcomes that are used to assess the effectiveness
 of barazas in changing service delivery an associated outcomes in agriculture.
 Results are reported in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:anova_ag"

\end_inset

.
 We start by looking if the baraza programme affected the use of modern
 inputs in agriculture.
 A first outcome looks at whether the household used inorganic fertilizers
 (DAP, Urea, NPK, Foliar, TSP, SSP, MOP) during the last 12 months.
 The first column reports sample averages, with standard deviation in brackets
 below.
 We find that about

 percent of households in the sample give an affirmative answer to this
 question.
 In the second column, we report differences in outcomes between households
 that received a sub-county level baraza (i.e.
 the crossed treatment of a sub-county information baraza and a sub-county
 deliberation baraza; the bottom right in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

) and households that did not receive any baraza (pure control; the top
 left in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Factorial-design"

\end_inset

).
 We see that the proportion of households that reports using inorganic fertilize
r is

 percentage points lower among the sub-group of households that were exposed
 to a sub-county level baraza that consists of both the information and
 the deliberation component than among households that did not receive any
 baraza (second column).
 However, this difference is not statistically significant.
 In the third column, we report differences between outcomes of households
 that live in areas where an information baraza was organized (either only
 an information baraza or a crossed information and deliberation baraza;
 top and bottom right of Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 an information baraza (either pure control or only a deliberation baraza;

 We see that adoption of inorganic fertilizer is

 percentage points higher among households that were exposed to an information
 baraza.
 However, also here, the difference is not significant.
 In the fourth column, we report differences between outcomes of households
 that live in areas where a deliberation baraza was organized (either only
 a deliberation baraza or a crossed information and deliberation baraza;
 bottom left and right of Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 a deliberation baraza (either pure control or information only baraza;
 top left and right of Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "fig:Factorial-design"

\end_inset

).
 We also do not find differences in terms of inorganic fertilizer use.
 Finally, in the fifth column, we compare households that were exposed to
 a district level baraza to pure control households.
 Again, no impact of the district level baraza is found on this outcome.

 sub-county level baraza took place as opposed to in areas where no baraza
 was conducted, but the difference is not significant.
 We find negative point estimates for the relative effects of both the informati
on and the deliberation component, but effects are imprecisely estimated.
 Finally, we find adoption of improved seed to be lower in areas where a
 district level baraza was conducted, but the difference with areas that
 did not receive a baraza is not significant.
 Adoption of improved seed and inorganic fertilizer was included in the
 index that is used for the confirmatory analysis.

 percent of households report that they received improved seed from the
 government extension system (through an extension agent, from the National
 Agricultural Advisory Services (NAADS) or through Operation Wealth Creation
 (OWC) that replaced NAADS).
 We find that this is

 percentage points higher in areas where a sub-county level baraza took
 place.
 We further see that this is especially due to the deliberation component
 of sub-county level barazas.
 In areas where such a baraza was held, the share is

\end_layout

\end_inset

 percentage points higher than in areas were citizens were not given the
 opportunity to engage with their leaders.
 We find no such effects from district level barazas.
 Direct comparison of district and sub-county level barazas indicate that
 sub-county level barazas are significantly more effective in increasing
 the likelihood that households report to have received these inputs from
 government.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We then check if household changed with respect to the use of agro-chemicals.
 This includes the use of pesticides, herbicides, fungicides and acaricides
 during the last 12 months.
 Overall, almost half of all households in the sample report using some
 form of agro-chemicals.
 We do not find evidence that the baraza intervention affected the use of
 these inputs.
 Finally, we consider the use of modern inputs and methods in livestock
 rearing over the last 12 months.
 This includes improved animal breeds, the use of modern feeds, drugs, and
 artificial insemination.

 percent of households report that they used such inputs and this proportion
 is similar across different experimental groups.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We then turn to agricultural advisory services.
 We first investigate if the barazas have affected access to extension at
 home.
 We estimate the percentage of households in our sample who report that
 they were visited by an expert (e.g.
 crop or livestock extension agent, or community-based facilitator or another
 experienced farmer) at the home in the last 12 months.
 We find that access to extension, although higher than at baseline, is
 still low, with only about 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
Sexpr{format(round(df_averages[1,8],digits=2)*100,nsmall=0)}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 percent of households reporting that they received such a visit.
 We find that this percentage is significantly higher among households that
 were exposed to a sub-county level baraza.
 The effect is large, amounting to an increase of 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
Sexpr{format(abs(round(df_ancova[1,1,8],digits=3)*100),nsmall=1)}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 percentage points.
 The effect seems to come from a combination of the information and deliberation
 components; the components in itself do not seem to affect the outcome
 enough to render if significant.
 We also find that this effect is absent among households that live in sub-count
ies that received a the district level baraza.
 A direct comparison of extension at home between households that were exposed
 to a district level baraza and households that were exposed to a sub-county
 level baraza confirms that sub-county level barazas are significantly more
 effective.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Home visits by extension officers are not the only way in which households
 have access to information.
 Extension offices, demonstration sites and model farmers are also an integral
 part of the Ugandan agricultural advisory system.
 Especially after the establishment of NAADS, such a demand-led service
 component that can be consulted by farmers when the need arises became
 more important than the more supply-driven component of training and visit.
 We thus also inquire if anyone in the household visited an extension office,
 demonstration site, or model farmer in the past year.
 We find that about 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
Sexpr{format(round(df_averages[1,9],digits=2)*100,nsmall=0)}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 percent of households in our sample report access to extension in this
 way.
 While the results are in line with extension visits at home, differences
 are not significant.
 Access to extension, both at home or though extension offices and demonstration
 sites, was also included as key outcomes to assess impact using in the
 agriculture and overall index.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find that three quarters of households in our sample mention that there
 are agricultural enterprises, improved technologies or inputs you would
 like to adopt, indicating significant demand for advisory services.
 We also find that, according to citizens, service providers and policy
 makers are not always aware of the needs of farmers.
 The table shows that only

Sexpr{format(round(df_averages[1,11],digits=2)*100,nsmall=0)}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 percent of households is of the opinion that officials are aware of which
 services farmers need.
 While we do not see that this percentage differs between treatment and
 control for sub-county level barazas, we do see that a district level baraza
 reduced this percentage.
 This may indicate that a district level baraza makes the mismatch between
 what farmers need and what officials think farmers need more salient.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Related to the previous outcome, we ask how decisions related to what topics
 to cover in agricultural extension are made.
 We define this outcome in a negative way, that is, the indicator is true
 if decisions are made without consultation.
 We see that about

 percent of households report the presence of farmer groups or cooperatives
 in their village.
 In the agricultural sector in Uganda, such groups are very important.
 They are actively promoted by the government.
 In fact, to be able to receive inputs from the government extension system,
 farmers are strongly encouraged to form such groups.
 We find that sub-county level barazas increase the likelihood that farmer
 cooperatives or groups are formed in the villages in Uganda.
 It seems that the deliberative component is the main driver behind this
 result.
 We also find that this effect is specific to interventions at the sub-county
 level.
 We further find that a higher share of farmer groups in areas that received
 a sub-county level baraza received support from government.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The final two questions focus more on marketing.
 Connecting farmers to markets is also an important strategy outlined in
 the Agriculture Sector Strategic Plan (ASSP).
 The first outcome relates to the likelihood that farmers are supported
 by government through a village procurement committee.
 In the sample, about

 A second questions is similar but looks at the role of cooperatives in
 marketing support.
 We generally find no effects of the baraza intervention, except perhaps
 for an increase of almost

 percentage points in the likelihood that cooperatives assist with marketing
 in areas that received a sub-county baraza.
 Both of these outcomes were also included in the index to assess overall
 impact.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Infrastructure
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A second important area in which we expect to see an impact of the baraza
 programme is in infrastructure.
 We primarily focus on drinking water infrastructure.
 Results are in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A first outcome we consider is whether the household uses an unprotected
 water source during dry season.
 This is measured as the share of households that report that the main source
 of drinking water during the dry season is surface water, an unprotected
 dug well or an unprotected spring.
 We find that about 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
Sexpr{format(round(df_averages[1,17]*100,digits=0),nsmall=0)}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 percent of households in the sample report that they are using an unprotected
 water source.
 The baraza intervention does not seem to affect this proportion.
 This outcome is included in the infrastructure index.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A second outcome we look at (and is also included in the index) is the distance
 to the primary water source during the dry season.
 This was measured in km, but trimmed and transformed using the inverse
 hyperbolic transformation.
 We find that, on average, households have to walk about 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
Sexpr{format(round(mean(baseline_desc$dist_source,na.rm=T),digits=2),nsmall=1)}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 km.
 While this distance seems to reduce in all comparisons, and especially
 for barazas held at the district level where we find a reduction of approximate
ly 9 percent, it is never significantly different from zero.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The third outcome, also part of the index, is the time that one must wait
 at the water source, measured in minutes.
 This continuous variable was also trimmed and transformed.
 We find that households must wait on average about 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
Sexpr{format(round(mean(baseline_desc$wait_source,na.rm=T),digits=0),nsmall=0)}

\end_inset

 minutes.
 We find that waiting time in areas that were exposed to the sub-county
 level baraza intervention reduced by about 25 percent.
 The deliberation component seems to be mostly responsible for this reduction.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fourth outcome variable assesses changes in the presence of a water
 user committee in the village.
 Overall, about

\end_layout

\end_inset

 percent of households report that such a committee is present in their
 village.
 We do not find that this share varies between the different experimental
 groups.
 Consistent with the finding that deliberation has been found to increase
 subsequent citizen involvement in community affairs 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "bjorkman2017experimental"
literal "true"

\end_inset

, we see that the deliberation component leads to an increase in the likelihood
 that a household member is a member of a water user committee.
 We do not find that the baraza intervention increases the likelihood that
 these committees hold public meetings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Households were also asked if they were satisfied with the quality of the
 water that is available at the source during the dry season.
 About

 percent respond that they are satisfied or very satisfied with the drinking
 water.
 We do not find that households that were exposed to the baraza intervention
 are more or less likely to report that they are (very) satisfied with the
 quality of drinking water during the dry season.
 Half of the households report that they treat drinking water before drinking
 it, either by boiling it or treating it with chlorine.
 The likelihood that households treat water reduces somewhat for the information
 treatment.
 This may be due to the belief held in many households that water from a
 safe sources does not need additional treatment.

We include one question related to road infrastructure.
 We ask how far the household is located from the nearest all weather road.
 We find that in the full sample a household lives on average 26 km from
 a road.
 We do not find that the baraza programme reduces the distance to the nearest
 all weather road.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Health
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We now look at outcomes in the health sphere (Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:anova_health"

\end_inset

).
 One problem with public health related outcomes is that some outcomes related
 to quality of service delivery in health centres will only be available
 for households that have visited government health facilities, reducing
 sample size too much to maintain acceptable power.
 Furthermore, the intervention may also affect the likelihood that households
 visit a government health facilities, introducing selection bias.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first two outcomes we consider attempt to assess changes in access or
 use of public health facilities.
 A first indicator measures demand for public health services for illness.
 In particular, we construct an indicator that is true if the household
 head responds that treatment would be sought in a health center 2, 3, 4
 or in a regional referral hospital if a member of his/her household had
 fever.
 We find that 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
Sexpr{format(round(df_averages[1,25]*100,digits=0),nsmall=0)}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 percent of households respond that they would seek treatment in a government
 health facility.
 This proportion is independent of the treatment groups.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A similar indicator attempts to assess demand for public health services
 for maternal health care, and asks if treatment would be sought in a health
 center 2, 3, 4 or in a regional referral hospital if a member of the household
 was to give birth.
 This percentage is even higher: about 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
Sexpr{format(round(df_averages[1,26]*100,digits=0),nsmall=0)}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 percent would go to a government health facility to give birth.
 Again, this proportion is not affected by the baraza programme.
 Both outcomes are included in the health index.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, we ask if a Village Health Team (VHT) is present in the village.
 VHTs are very important in front-line health care provision in Uganda.
 They also have prominent roles in government health interventions, such
 as immunization campaigns or the distribution of bed nets.
 We find that overall, about 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
Sexpr{format(round(df_averages[1,27]*100,digits=0),nsmall=0)}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 percent of households report that a VHT is present in their village.
 The presence of a VHT is not impacted by the baraza intervention.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the baraza tries to increase citizen engagement, we also check if households
 that were exposed to a baraza are more likely to participate in VHTs.
 We thus asked if any member of the household was a member of a VHT.
 We see that in about 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
Sexpr{format(round(df_averages[1,28]*100,digits=0),nsmall=0)}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 percent of our sample, at least one household member is part of a VHT.
 The baraza intervention does not increase the likelihood that individuals
 participate as VHT members.
 Furthermore, the baraza intervention attempts to encourages sharing of
 information.
 As such, we expect that being exposed to a baraza may encourage VHTs to
 organize more public meetings.
 We find that overall, 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
Sexpr{format(round(df_averages[1,29]*100,digits=0),nsmall=0)}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 percent of households state that VHTs have organized a public meeting in
 the last year.
 We find that this proportion is significantly higher in areas that were
 exposed to a sub-county level baraza.
 This effect seems driven by the deliberative component of a sub-county
 baraza.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also consider distance to the nearest government health facility, measured
 in km (trimmed and transformed using the inverse hyperbolic sine transformation
).
 Overall, average distance to the nearest government health facility is
 almost 50 km.
 We do not find that barazas reduce this distance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We then turn to health outcomes.
 We start by asking if any member of the household has been sick during
 the last year.
 This was the case in two thirds of the households in our sample.
 The intervention did not reduce morbidity in our sample.
 We then ask for each sick person in the household to record how many days
 he or she was ill, and use this to calculate the total number of sick days
 at the household level in the last year.
 The average household recorded almost 50 sick days according to this definition.
 We also do not find that the intervention affected the (trimmed and transformed
) number of sick days.
 We also look at the number of days household members were unable to go
 to school or to work, which provides an indication of the severity of illness.
 Calculated similarly to the previous outcome, we find that in the average
 household about 35 school- or workdays were missed due to illness.
 Again, there is no significant reduction in this (trimmed and transformed)
 number.
 This last health outcome measure was included in the health index.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We then ask how long one had to wait before being attended to (in minutes,
 trimmed and transformed).
 We find that the sample mean for this outcome is about 90 minutes.
 While we see that waiting time reduces for most comparisons, the differences
 are never significant.
 Potentially, the reduced sample size resulted in too little power to detect
 a difference.
 This outcome was also included in the health index.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next question that was included in the index was again asked to all
 households.
 In particular, we inquire if a traditional health practitioner was consulted
 in the last year.
 In one in four households in our sample, this was the case.
 The baraza intervention did not affect this percentage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One problem that often crops up in the health sector is absenteeism.
 To assess this, we ask who examined the patient in the health center.
 Ideally this should be the doctor or in-charge.
 If this person is absent, patients are generally examined by nurses or
 lab technicians.
 We thus construct an indicator that is one if the household responds that
 the patient was investigated by the doctor or the in-charge, and zero otherwise.
 Only in 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
Sexpr{format(round(df_averages[1,36]*100,digits=0),nsmall=0)}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 percent of the cases, a qualified person appears to do the examination.
 Surprisingly, the deliberation component of the baraza seems to reduce
 this likelihood somewhat.
 We also look at the time that the examination takes.
 The average examination in our sample took about 22 minutes.
 There is no change related to the intervention.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Health care in Uganda is supposed to be free.
 However, corruption is widespread and often patients are required to make
 payments to receive care.
 We find that about 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
Sexpr{format(round(df_averages[1,38]*100,digits=0),nsmall=0)}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 percent of households report that payment was required the last time they
 visited a government health facility.
 There is no impact of the intervention.
 Related, users often complain about a lack of drugs in government health
 facilities.
 We asked if, during the last visit to a government health centre, drugs
 were received (indicating that drugs were available).
 We also asked if drugs had to be purchased from outside of the hospital
 (indicating that at least some drugs were missing).
 While 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

Sexpr{format(round(df_averages[1,39]*100,digits=0),nsmall=0)}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 percent of households report that they received medicines in the health
 centre, almost all of them also mentioned that they had to also buy drugs
 outside of the hospital.
 For neither indicator, the intervention seems to make a difference.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We further probe for a subjective assessment of the overall quality of care
 at the health facility.
 Most households report that they are satisfied or very satisfied with services
 received at the government health facility.
 This seems to increase in areas where a sub-county level baraza took place
 and there is also a sizable difference in outcomes when comparing sub-county
 level baraza outcomes to district level baraza outcomes.
 However, none of the differences are significant.

 One key outcome in

 is immunization.
 However, we already find close to 100 percent immunization rates in our
 baseline data.
 Another outcome is child mortality.
 Child mortality rates at baseline were estimated at 38 per 1000 live births,
 which was deemed too low to include in the analysis.

\begin_layout Standard
Education outcomes to assess impact of the intervention suffers from a similar
 problem as the one encountered with health outcomes: not all households
 in the sample have children in school, and so for many of the outcomes
 related to education, sample size becomes small.
 This also affects the indices.
 Results are presented in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the quality of public education is poor, households will be less likely
 to send their children to public schools.
 A first obvious outcome is thus to simply compare the number of children
 within the households that attend public school (either Universal Primary
 Education or Universal Secondary Education).
 We find that the average household in our sample had almost two children
 in government schools, but that enrollment rates are not affected by the
 baraza intervention.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Access to public education is also influenced by the distance to a public
 school.
 We thus recorded distance to primary or secondary school (or the average
 if both are reported; trimmed and transformed).
 We find that on average, households live about 3 km from a government operated
 school.
 Also for this outcome, the baraza program did not make an impact.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also look at school infrastructure.
 First, we ask households if the primary or secondary school attended by
 any of their children has a complete boundary fence.
 In the complete sample, it was reported that only about

\end_inset

 percent of schools have such a fence.
 The lack of a fence was a frequent complaints from parents during qualitative
 work.
 We also ask if the school has electricity and if there is a water source
 available in the school.
 We find that overall, about

 percent have a water source.
 We find that sub-county level baraza seem to improve school infrastructure.
 We considered many other infrastructure related outcomes, such as the number
 of classrooms and availability of functioning toilets for both girls and
 boys, but baseline data suggested there were generally no issues related
 to these outcomes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also look at how the school is managed, and how parents are involved.
 For instance, we look at whether the school has a Parent Teacher Association
 (PTA) and a School Management Committee (SMC).
 Almost all schools have a PTA.
 We further find that

 percent of households state the primary or secondary school attended by
 any of their children has a SMC.
 However, not all households are informed about SMC meetings.
 The baraza intervention does not seem to affect how schools are managed,
 how parents can participate, or how information is shared.
 Finally, we ask households if an inspector had visited the school in the
 year before the survey.
 We find that about

 of a baraza.

\begin_layout Standard
In this section, we look at some other outcomes, including some of the mechanism
s through which the baraza intervention is assumed to impact outcomes.
 More in particular, we explore if the baraza program affected interfacing
 with politicians and civil servants, contributions to public goods (both
 cash and in-kind), and perceptions of service quality and prioritization.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the primary aims of the community forums is to increase communication
 between politicians, civil servants and the citizens.
 We thus try to assess if citizens interact more with politicians and service
 providers as a result of the interventions.
 We ask how long it has been since the respondent spoke personally to various
 officials for reasons related to service provision in agriculture, health,
 education, water or roads.
 Based on the answer, we construct an indicator variable that denotes if
 the household had a meeting or not.
 The time frame changes depending on the official.
 For instance, for the LC1 chairperson, the indicator takes the value of
 one if the respondent spoke to him or her within the last month.
 For the head teacher, the reference period is 6 months.
 For the other officials (sub-county chief, health management unit member
 and water committee member), the indicator is true if contact was sought
 in the past year.
 Results are in Table

Note: First column reports sample means (and standard deviations below);
 Column 2 reports effect (and standard errors below) of the sub-county level
 baraza intervention; Column 3 reports the effect (and standard errors below)
 of the information component of the baraza intervention; Column 4 reports
 the effect (and standard errors below) of the deliberation component of
 the baraza intervention; Column 5 reports the effect (and standard errors
 below) of the administrative placement of the baraza intervention.
 **, * and + denotes significance at the 1, 5 and 10 percent levels as assessed
 using randomization inference.
 Reported standard errors are clustered at the level of randomization.

 percent of households in our sample have met with the LC1 chair in the

 percent of respondents report that they met with the sub-county chief in
 the last year.
 We do not find that the baraza intervention changes this likelihood.
 We do see that the information component of the baraza increases the likelihood
 that citizens interface with the head teacher or with members of the school
 management unit.
 We also see that the information component of the sub-county level baraza
 increases the likelihood of meetings with water committee members, but
 the difference is not significant.
 Finally, and similar to meetings with sub-county chiefs, few citizens report
 meeting with health unit management committee members.
 The index also shows that the largest effect on meetings is due to the
 information component, but the effect is not significant.
 While the indices do not suggest an impact on contacts between citizens
 and officials, we do find that virtually all coefficients on sub-county
 level intervention are positive.
 We also find that a sub-county level barazas are significantly more effective
 in increasing interactions between citizens and health unit management
 committee members.

\begin_layout Standard
The baraza programme also attempts to increase a sense of community engagement.
 One way in which citizens can participate is though contributing to common
 goods such as public infrastructure, education of health services.
 We differentiate between cash contributions and in-kind contributions.

 percent of households indicate that they made in-kind contributions to
 public schools in their community in the last two years.
 Overall, most in-kind contributions are targeted towards drinking water
 facilities, and least in-kind contributions were going to dams or irrigation
 facilities, which is consistent with the difference in public nature of
 these facilities.
 Cash contributions are distributed similarly, except for the fact that
 contributions to bridges and roads generally take the form of labor contributio
ns.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find that the information component of the sub-county baraza reduces
 in-kind contributions but increases cash contributions.
 We further find that cash contributions are significantly higher in areas
 that were exposed to a district level baraza than in areas that were subjected
 to a sub-county level baraza.
 This is driven by significantly higher cash contributions towards schools
 (and to a lesser extent to drinking water infrastructure).
 For in-kind contributions, reductions in contributions are especially for
 schools and for government or community buildings.
 The increase in cash contributions as a result of the information component
 of the baraza intervention is especially for drinking water infrastructure.

Finally, we investigate if barazas result in changes in the perception of
 citizens on a range of problems.
 Respondents were given a statement, and using a 10 point likert scale,
 had to indicate how much they disagreed (1) or agreed (10) with the statement.
 The statements were based on extensive qualitative work where various stakehold
ers were interviewed and asked about the key problems surrounding public
 service provision in the different sectors.

 shows that households tend to agree more that access to drinking water
 sources is a serious problem as a result of the information component of
 a sub-county baraza.
 Households that received a deliberation focused sub-county level baraza
 are also more likely to agree that drinking water is usually dirty.
 In the area of public health provision, households that were exposed to
 a sub-county level information baraza are more likely to agree that access
 to a health centre or hospital is a serious problem than areas that were
 exposed to a district level baraza.
 We further find that households that were exposed to a sub-county level
 baraza indicate that lack of medicines at health centers or hospitals is
 less of a problem than in control areas.
 A direct comparison for this outcome between sub-county level barazas and
 district level barazas also yields a significant difference.
 We also ask about perceptions related to friendliness of staff and absenteeism.
 We find that households that live in areas that received the district level
 treatment are more inclined to say that absenteeism is a problem, but the
 difference is not significant.

\begin_layout Standard
We then look at perceptions in the area of education.
 We see that households are generally most concerned about poor quality
 learning outcomes, but think absenteeism is less of a problem.
 For none of the school related perceptions, we find a significant difference
 between the various groups.
 We also do not find that the perception of access to roads as a serious
 problem changes as a result of the barazas.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Respondents seem to perceive agricultural service delivery as the most problemat
ic area: Averages on the likert scales are fairly high when asked if farmers
 agree extension officers visit rarely, and that there is a lack of transparency
 in how farmers are selected to receive inputs from government.
 A perception index that combines all outcome indicates only a significant
 difference between sub-county level barazas and district level barazas,
 as sub-county level barazas lead to more disagreement and district level
 barazas to more agreement.

Heterogeneity in the timing of the intervention
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The slow roll-out of the intervention over an extended period of time also
 introduces variation in the time that passed between treatment administration
 and end-line data collection.
 For instance, the first barazas were held around June 2016 (about one year
 after the baseline) and so more than 3 years will have passed between treatment
 administration and end-line data collection.
 For the most recent barazas, there will only be a few months between treatment
 administration and end-line data collection.
 One may argue that sub-counties or districts that were treated early on
 have been exposed to the program much longer and hence one may expect larger
 effects on a range of outcomes for these sub-counties or districts than
 areas that only recently received treatment.
 At the same time, for some outcomes, effects of the baraza intervention
 may dissipate (or even reverse) over time as plans are abandoned and promises
 are not kept.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To capture this, we reran the analysis and added an interaction term between
 the treatment indicator and an indicator variable that takes the value
 of one if the baraza that the household was exposed to happened more than
 1 and a half years before the endline data collection.
 Results for the coefficient estimates of the interaction terms are summarized
 in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

For the agricultural sector, we do not find that the time elapsed between
 the intervention and endline data collection affects the impact of sub-county
 level barazas we found in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Summary-of-baraza"
plural "false"

\end_inset

.
 Looking at individual outcomes, we do find that it takes some time for
 the deliberation component of the baraza to increase the likelihood that
 households are assisted by cooperatives in marketing.
 We also find that district level barazas increase the likelihood that household
s receive NAADS support by almost 5 percent points immediately after the
 event, but that this positive effect is counteracted by negative effect
 of almost 10 percentage points after one and a half years.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find a significant negative interaction effect for the infrastructure
 index.
 This is primarily driven by the fact that distance to water source significantl
y reduces immediately after a sub-county level baraza was held, but increases
 again after some time, partially reversing the effect.
 This may indicate that officials start fixing boreholes as a result of
 complaints raised during the baraza event, but in the longer run the situation
 worsened as spare parts have been used up.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For outcomes in the health sector, we find negative interaction effects
 for sub-county level barazas and for district level barazas.
 We find that the initial strong positive effect of district level barazas
 on the likelihood of seeking treatment at a government health facility
 (both for general health care and maternal health cares) disappears in
 the long run.
 At the same time, a significant interaction effect of district level barazas
 on the number of days sick.
 The negative interaction effect for the sub-county level baraza seems driven
 by a reduction of the likelihood that households turn to government health
 facilities for maternal health in the long term.
 We also find a significant interaction effect for the likelihood of visiting
 a traditional healer.
 This is consistent with households being disappointed by the lack of progress
 made in health centers following the baraza intervention.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For education, we do not find significant interaction effects based for
 the index.
 We do find a positive effect of sub-county level barazas on enrollment
 in the longer run.
 This positive long run effect seems due to the information component.
 We find that that the deliberation component leads to a 12 percentage point
 increase that the school was visited by an inspector if one allows for
 sufficient time.

 find that in the early nineties, schools in Uganda received only about
 13 percent of central capitation grants to cover non-wage expenses.
 While the situation likely improved over the year, elite capture of funds
 at intermediate levels remains a problem.
 We look at heterogeneity related baseline levels of elite capture, proxied
 by the share of the budget that was reportedly received in the year prior
 to baseline data collection.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Based on data we collected from government officials in all sub-counties,
 we estimate the average shares of the health, agriculture and education
 sector budgets that was not received.
 We find that, overall, only about three quarters of the budget was disbursed.
 The situation was worse in the agricultural sector, where on average 38
 percent of the budget was not received.
 In the education sector and in the health sector, disbursement rates are
 the same at 82 percent.
 For the analysis, we define an indicator variable that takes the value
 of one if the household lives in a sub-county for which overall disbursement
 was less than 85 percent and interact this variable with the treatment
 indicator.
 Results are reported in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:capture"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find that the information component of sub-county level baraza increases
 overall service delivery in areas characterized by relatively high levels
 of elite capture.
 For the agricultural sector, we find that the impact of sub-county level
 baraza we found in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Summary-of-baraza"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 is not subject to heterogeneity.
 However, we find that the information component of sub-county level barazas
 becomes significant in areas characterized by lower disbursement rates.
 This is driven by an increase in the likelihood that households received
 extension at home.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For infrastructure, we do not find significant interaction effects, although
 all coefficients are estimated positive.
 Looking at individual outcomes, we find a significant negative effect from
 sub-county level barazas on distance to the water source in areas with
 lower disbursement rates at baseline.
 We also find a significant negative effect for waiting time as a result
 of the deliberation component of sub-county level baraza in areas with
 high elite capture at baseline.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Accounting for elite capture at baseline also leads to a significant impact
 of the information component in the health sector.
 This seems to be driven by a substantial reduction in waiting time, but
 also by an increased demand for public health services.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, for the education sector, we also do not find significant interaction
 effects.
 Looking at individual outcomes, we find some indication that district level
 barazas reduce distance to public schools in areas with lower baseline
 disbursement rates.

Heterogeneity related to connections to persons in power
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Related to the previous, we suspect that connections to people in power
 can make barazas more effective.
 There are several reasons why this is the case.
 For instance, barazas attract a lot of attention, and politicians that
 hail from a sub-county where a baraza was held may face greater electoral
 punishment if they are not sensitive to the issues raised.
 Connections to people in powerful positions may make it easier to direct
 money from the center to the sub-county to respond to some of the concerns
 raised during baraza events.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

 thus reports interaction effects of the different interventions with an
 indicator for sub-counties where officials report if the sub-county has
 residents that occupy leadership positions such as minister, member of
 parliament, heads of government agencies, RDCs, and other district level
 officials.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We do not find any significant interaction effects based on the indices.
 However, coefficients are generally positive, especially for interactions
 with the deliberation focused sub-county baraza and district level barazas.
 Examples of positive interaction effects for individual outcomes include
 an increased likelihood of visiting extension offices, demonstration sites
 or model farmers and an increase in the likelihood that schools have a
 fence after a deliberation focused baraza.
 We also find a reduction in the use of unprotected water sources after
 a sub-county level baraza.

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 note that free-rider problems inherent to interventions aimed at increasing
 public action such as the baraza programme may be exacerbated by ethnic
 fractionalization, as in heterogeneous communities, social norms are likely
 to be less effective.
 In addition, they note that in such communities, government officials may
 also be less sensitive to non-monetary social rewards or sanctions.

\begin_layout Standard
In Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 a sub-county level indicator for high ethnic fractionalization.
 To construct this indicator, we follow 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

\end_inset

 and estimate sub-county level measures of ethno-linguistic fractionalization
 as one minus the sum of squared shares of the different ethno-linguistic
 groups in the sub-county.
 We then define sub-counties with high ethnic fractionalization as those
 with indices in excess of median ethno-linguistic fractionalization.

\begin_layout Standard
Contrary to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "bjorkman2010community"

\end_inset

, we find that barazas appear to be most effective in less homogeneous sub-count
ies.
 This seems to be particularly the case for district level baraza and combined
 information and deliberation barazas, and especially for outcomes in infrastruc
ture and the health sector.
 For the infrastructure sector we find particularly strong interaction effects
 for distance to water source and distance to all weather roads.
 Also in the health sector, distance to the nearest government health facility
 is reduced significantly as a result of both sub-county and district level
 barazas.
 In the education sector, we also find that sub-county level barazas reduce
 distance to nearest government schools in highly fractionalized communities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It may be that barazas facilitate the organization of communities in the
 absence of the social cohesion necessary to engage them in infrastructural
 works.
 Consistent with this explanation, we find that distance to the nearest
 water source, distance to the nearest road, distance to the nearest government
 health facility and distance to the nearest public school are all significantly
 higher in control areas with high baseline levels of ethnic fractionalization
 than in control areas that are more homogeneous.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Heterogeneity related to remoteness
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Heterogeneity related to the timing of the intervention, disbursement rates,
 connections to persons in power, and ethnic fractionalization all have
 its source at the sub-county level.
 Heterogeneity may also be related to household level characteristics.
 During discussions with stakeholders, it was often argued that barazas
 may have different effects on households that live close to the sub-county
 headquarters versus those that live in more remote areas.
 At baseline, we collected data on the distance between the homestead of
 the household and the sub-county headquarter.
 We thus rerun the regressions but now add interaction effects for households
 that live 4 or more km away from the district headquarter.
 Results are summarized in Figure

\begin_layout Standard
There are some indications that district level barazas are effective for
 households that live further away from the sub-county.
 This is particularly the case for outcomes in the agricultural sector.
 We also find more positive treatment effects in the education sector if
 we focus on household that live further from the district headquarters.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Looking at the agricultural sector more in detail, we find that a district
 level baraza leads to a significant increase in the likelihood that households
 are visited by extension officers at home, the likelihood that they visit
 an extension office, demonstration plot or model farmers, the likelihood
 of being assisted by NAADS, and the likelihood of being supported by a
 marketing cooperative.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Remote households also benefit from sub-county level barazas in terms of
 access to a protected water source.
 District level barazas reduce waiting time at the source for this sub-group.
 For access to public health, an overall positive deliberation effect is
 counter-acted by a negative effect among households living further away
 from the district headquarter.

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 are reassuring, it should be noted that pre-treatment characteristics were
 collected some time ago and results may be different if more recent data
 is used and/or if selection happened on characteristics that changed over
 time.
 Therefore, we revisit the comparisons between control sub-counties and
 sub-counties that were allocated to a treatment cell but ended up not being
 treated, but now use endline data.
 Specifically for this reason, as mentioned in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Balance-between-planned-to-treat"

\end_inset

, instead of simply collecting endline data from the (planned) control sub-count
ies, we also collected endline data from sub-counties that were supposed
 to receive a treatment but did not get one (See also footnote 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "fn:In-section-"

).
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 thus compares end-line outcomes between households that were planned to
 receive a particular treatment but did not end up receiving the treatment
 to outcomes of households that were assigned to serve as a control for
 the particular treatment.

While results need to be interpreted with caution due to small sample size,
 we do find significant differences between planned but not treated sub-counties
 and sub-counties that were allocated to the control condition for the agricultu
ral sector.
 For instance, we find that households that were supposed to receive a sub-count
y level baraza treatment but did not get one are 10 percentage points more
 likely to indicate that they visited an extension office, demonstration
 site or a model farmers.
 However, as this difference is positive, it could be argued that OPM seemed
 to have prioritized sub-counties with poorer service delivery in the agricultur
al sector.
 As a result, positive results obtained from comparing treated and control
 groups are likely to underestimate the true impacts of the treatment.

Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To improve governance and public service delivery in Uganda, the Office
 of the Prime Minister (OPM) organizes community forums—popularly known
 as barazas—where citizens receive information from government officials,
 and get the opportunity to directly engage with them.
 In 2015, we designed a study aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of this
 policy intervention.
 The evaluations set out to answer four research questions: (1) what is
 the impact of the baraza as implemented by the OPM? (2) What is the relative
 effectiveness of the information component of a baraza? (3) What is the
 relative effectiveness of the deliberation component of a baraza? And:
 (4) Should a baraza be organized at the district level or at the sub-county
 level.
 Baseline data on more than 12,500 households spread over almost 250 sub-countie
s in about 40 districts throughout Uganda was collected and OPM started
 implementing barazas following our experimental design and protocols.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
OPM faced various complications that affected the timely roll-out of the
 barazas, including budgetary constraints and disruptions related to the
 general elections of 2016.
 This resulted in the decision to collect end-line information after partial
 roll-out, more than 4 years after baseline data was collected.
 Various strategies were followed to test, and reduce the consequences of,
 potential selection bias introduced by this partial roll out.
 Early 2020, endline data was collected on 6,700 households.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Overall, following the pre-analysis plan we find that the baraza program
 did not have a significant impact on public service delivery or its associated
 outcomes.
 There are some indications that sub-county level barazas had a positive
 impact on service delivery in the agricultural sector, and that this impact
 is significantly larger than the impact associated with district level
 barazas.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Looking at individual outcomes, we find that households reported increased
 access to agricultural extension in areas that were exposed to a sub-county
 level baraza.
 Furthermore, the deliberation component appeared responsible for an increase
 in the share of households that reported that they received improved seed
 from the government extension system.
 We also found that sub-county level barazas increased the likelihood that
 farmer cooperatives or groups were formed in the villages in Uganda.
 Interestingly, it seems that the deliberative component was the main driver
 behind this result, suggesting deliberation may be important to increase
 involvement in community affairs.
 It is also consistent with the previous result, as cooperatives are important
 vehicles to organize input distribution in Uganda.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For individual outcomes included in the infrastructure index, we find that
 the time that one must wait at the water source reduced by about 25 percent
 after a sub-county level baraza took place.
 The deliberation component seemed to be mostly responsible for this reduction.
 Furthermore, we again find that the deliberation component seemed to increase
 community participation, as more households reported to be part of the
 water user committee.
 Impact on the health sector was limited.
 The baraza intervention did seem to be somewhat successful in encouraging
 sharing of information, as households stated that VHTs were more likely
 to organized a public meeting after a sub-county level baraza was organized.
 Finally, we find that sub-county level baraza seemed to improve school
 infrastructure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also explored if the baraza program affected various aspects that are
 at the core of community-based monitoring, such as interfacing with politicians
 and civil servants, perceptions of service quality and prioritization,
 and contributions to public goods (both cash and in-kind).
 There is some evidence that the information component of the baraza increased
 meetings with officials or service providers: even though only a significant
 effect was found on meetings with the head teacher or members of the school
 management committee, coefficients on all other indicators were positive
 and often substantial.
 We further found that the information component of the sub-county baraza
 reduced in-kind contributions, but increased cash contributions.
 This may indicate that barazas increase trust in officials and strengthens
 the social contract.
 We further found that cash contributions were higher in areas that were
 exposed to a district level baraza than in areas that were subjected to
 a sub-county level baraza.
 Finally, we found that barazas changed citizens’ perception of a range
 of problems.
 In general, sub-county level barazas led to more disagreement and district
 level barazas to more agreement that a range of issues in public service
 delivery were problematic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When looking at heterogeneity in treatment effects, we often see that initially
 positive effects turn negative after some time.
 This may indicate that investments are made immediately after the baraza
 events, but resources dry up after some time.
 It also suggests that over time, households become increasingly frustrated
 with the lack of progress made against the actions that were promised during
 barazas.
 At the same time, some important outcome such as a reduction in morbidity
 and an increase in school enrollment only materialize after some time.
 We further find that the information component of sub-county level baraza
 increases overall service delivery in areas characterized by relatively
 high levels of elite capture.
 There is some evidence that sub-counties with connections to people in
 important government positions benefit more from barazas (especially from
 barazas that emphasize deliberation), but effects are imprecisely estimated.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also find that barazas appear to be most effective in less homogeneous
 sub-counties.
 In sub-counties characterized by substantial ethnic heterogeneity, health,
 school and water infrastructure seems to be lacking.
 This suggests that baraza may be an effective way to mobilize communities
 that are less likely to invest in public goods due to weak social ties.
 Finally, we look at heterogeneity related to remoteness and find that particula
rly district level barazas benefit remote households more than households
 that live close to the sub-county headquarters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While we did not find that the baraza impacts public service delivery in
 general, we did find a variety of interesting effects when we looked at
 individual outcomes and considered heterogeneity in the treatment effects.
 The fact that our results are somewhat more encouraging than those found
 in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "raffler2018weakness"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 may also be related to the fact that our intervention is organized by the
 government.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "raffler2018weakness"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 find indications that presence of sub-county officials during the programming
 boosted the impact of the intervention on treatment quality in health centers.
 Our analysis thus confirms that top-down monitoring may be more important
 in changing behavior of civil servants, but that community involvement
 may be an effective way to pressure officials into increased top-down monitorin
g.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More generally, our analysis suggests that impact from barazas may be highly
 localized and context specific.
 Heterogeneous treatment effects have been documented in similar community-based
 monitoring interventions, complicating estimation of average treatment
 effects

.
 Barazas are fairly broad interventions that attempt to address a range
 of issues in a heterogeneous setting, resulting in treatments that are
 unlikely to be very standardized across treatment units, at least compared
 to typical treatments in bio-medical sciences.
 A baraza in one sub-county may evolve in a very different direction than
 a baraza in another sub-county.
 Both barazas may be effective in their own right, yet outcomes are averaged
 over treatment units and impact diluted.
 This also helps explain diverging findings from a less ambitious qualitative
 exploration of the likely impact of the baraza programme 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "van2018impact"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 There, we got the impression that barazas were useful at improving public
 service delivery across sectors, with stakeholders having no difficulty
 providing examples of changes they felt were the direct result of the baraza
 being held: projects that were previously dragging were finished or taken
 up afresh; sub-standard work was redone; and in some instances, priorities
 were changed to better align with citizens’ needs.

 Baseline data on 12,545 households was collected between June and September
 2015.
 Sample averages are reported in the first column (with standard errors

 For example, we see that the average household consists of about

 percent of households report that they have access to agricultural extension.
 In the second column, we report differences between baseline characteristics
 of households that were planned to receive a sub-county level combined
 information and deliberation baraza, and those that would not be exposed
 to any baraza.
 We find that distance to the nearest road is slightly though statistically
 significantly higher in areas that were planned to receive a sub-county
 level baraza.
 When comparing households that were planned to be exposed to a sub-county
 level information baraza to households that would not receive a sub-county
 level information baraza (column 3), we see that that households are slightly
 larger in the former group, and the difference is significant.
 The average household has two to three children attending a public school.
 We also find a slight pre-treatment imbalance on this outcome for the informati
on treatment.

 Column 2 reports differences (and standard errors below) between baseline
 characteristics of households that were planned to receive a sub-county
 level combined information and deliberation baraza, and those that would
 not be exposed to any baraza; Column 3 reports differences (and standard
 errors below) between baseline characteristics of households that would
 receive a sub-county level information baraza, and those that would not
 receive a sub-county level information baraza; Column 4 reports differences
 (and standard errors below) between baseline characteristics of households
 that were allocted to receive a sub-county level deliberation baraza, and
 those that would not receive a sub-county level deliberation baraza; Column
 5 (and standard errors below) reports differences between baseline characterist
ics of households that were planned to receive a district level combined
 information and deliberation baraza, and those that would not be exposed
 to any baraza;  **, * and + denotes significance at the 1, 5 and 10 percent
 levels.
 Reported standard errors are clustered at the level of randomization.
 Distance to all weather road is trimmed at 5 percent and transformed using
 the inverse hyperbolic sine transformation.

In the fourth column of Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

, we report differences between households that would be exposed to a sub-county
 deliberation baraza and households that would not.
 For this treatment, we cannot reject balance on any of the variables.
 In the last column, we report differences in outcomes between households
 that would be exposed to a district level baraza and households that would
 not be exposed to any baraza.
 Also here, we do not find any significant difference.
 Overall, out of 40 comparisons, we find that two differences are significant,
 which is what one would expect to find due to chance alone.
 As such, we conclude that the randomization of the original design was
 successful.
