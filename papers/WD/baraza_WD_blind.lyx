\begin_layout Title
The impact of community-based monitoring on public service delivery: A randomize
d control trial in Uganda
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
In many developing countries, poor delivery of public services remains an
 important problem.
 Through community-based monitoring, beneficiaries of public services can
 apply bottom-up pressure to under-performing service providers and their
 political leadership.
 In this spirit, the Government of Uganda organizes community fora—popularly
 known as barazas—where citizens receive information from government officials
 and get the opportunity to challenge them.
 We designed a cluster randomized control trial to assess the impact of
 this policy intervention on public service delivery in agriculture, health,
 education, and infrastructure.
 We further test the relative importance of the two main components of the
 intervention—information provision and citizen engagement.
 We also compare the effectiveness of barazas organized at the district
 level to the effectiveness of barazas organized at the sub-county level.
 Following a pre-specified confirmatory analysis, we do not find that the
 intervention has significant effects on general public service delivery,
 though there are signs of improvement in agricultural sector public services.
 We discuss some of the potential reasons for this finding, including assumption
s underlying the impact pathways, the political context in which the program
 was implemented, and challenges related to the evaluation of large policy
 programs.

In many developing countries, the delivery of public services remains problemati
c.
 Public infrastructure, such as roads or boreholes for drinking water, is
 poor.
 The quality of service provided in hospitals and schools is low.
 Absenteeism and corruption are endemic.
 This is also the case in Uganda, where the public service sector suffers
 from high levels of elite capture, ineffective monitoring, and weak accountabil
ity 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "reinikka2004local"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 In response to this, the Office of the Prime Minister (OPM) implemented
 the baraza program, an initiative of the president of Uganda, to improve
 public service delivery by enhancing public involvement in holding the
 government accountable for service delivery in relation to resources spent
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "New1"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 The program brings politicians, civil servants, and citizens together in
 town hall-type meetings (barazas) to share information and engage with
 each other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since 2009, barazas have been organized in sub-counties throughout Uganda.
 However, no rigorous impact evaluation was undertaken until now.
 A first objective of this paper is thus to assess if the program had an
 impact on public service delivery and associated outcomes.
 Furthermore, in 2012, the OPM decided to organize subsequent barazas at
 a higher administrative level (district) instead of at the sub-county level,
 mainly to reduce cost and speed up roll-out.
 A second major objective of this study is to inform policy makers on the
 consequences of this change in terms of effectiveness of the program.
 A third objective of the study is to assess the relative importance of
 the two main components of a generic baraza event and differentiate between,
 on the one hand, the impact of arming citizens with information related
 to budgeting and spending, and, on the other hand, the impact of allowing
 citizens to engage with public servants and politicians in moderated question-a
nd-answer sessions.
 We answer these research questions using a cluster randomized control trial
 (RCT).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are several studies that look at the impact of community-based monitoring
 on public service delivery, many of them implemented in Uganda.
 A landmark study is 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "bjorkman2009power"
literal "true"

\end_inset

, who analyze the impact of a community-driven local accountability project
 in primary health care provision in Uganda.
 They find that community-based monitoring resulted in significant improvements
 in health care delivery, utilization, and health outcomes (most notably
 child mortality and weight-for-age z-scores) after one year, and confirm
 in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "bjorkman2017experimental"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 that these effects also hold in the longer run.
 More recently, however, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "raffler2018weakness"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 come to different conclusions when testing an intervention closely modeled
 on the one of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "bjorkman2009power"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 in a similar setting.
 The study, involving a three-wave panel of more than 14,000 households,
 shows that the intervention was able to change the behavior of public service
 providers.
 However, it did not find that it directly increased community monitoring,
 nor generated improvements in health outcomes, at least in the short run.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our study contributes to this literature in various ways.
 First, it is one of the few studies that consider the role of the jurisdictiona
l tier on the effectiveness of community-based monitoring.
 The level at which the town hall-style meetings are organized may affect
 their effectiveness in opposing ways: interventions at a more local level
 may result in more relevant issues being scrutinized.
 However, qualitative explorations suggest that, often, issues raised in
 lower level barazas are beyond the operational jurisdiction of the officials
 that are present 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "van2018impact"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 This may be less of a problem if barazas are organized at district-level.
 Most other studies consider interventions that were placed at local jurisdictio
nal levels.
 For instance, the intervention in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "raffler2018weakness"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 was implemented in health centers and their associated catchment areas,
 defined as the three villages closest to the health center.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Second, our study evaluates the impact of a large-scale, high-profile policy
 intervention that receives broad support within the government, among opinion
 leaders and among citizens in Uganda.
 Such interventions may trigger an entirely different set of dynamics than
 interventions that are organized by local or international Non-governmental
 organizations (NGOs), as in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "bjorkman2009power"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "raffler2018weakness"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 For instance, many of the actors involved may find that NGOs are not mandated
 when it comes to public services such as health and education.
 This is also consistent with suggestive evidence in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "raffler2018weakness"
literal "true"

\end_inset

, who find that the presence of sub-county officials during their community-base
d monitoring intervention boosted its impact.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Third, barazas take a comprehensive, multi-sector approach, enabling cross-secto
ral planning and potentially allowing for re-allocation of resources across
 sectors to solve problems that were identified during these meetings.
 Some of the problems most mentioned by users, such as hygiene in health
 centers or accessibility, involve cooperation between heads of different
 sectors (for example, health and infrastructure to get access to water
 in health centers).
 Bringing civil servants from different sectors together and confronting
 them with the priorities of citizens may increase information sharing and
 cooperation between them.
 Most other studies focus on a single sector; health in particular seems
 to be a popular sector for community monitoring interventions

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This paper also serves as an illustration of the challenges of evaluating
 real-world policy interventions and how to deal with them.
 While we feel that field experiments with policy interventions provide
 greater external validity than the carefully designed and closely monitored
 ones implemented by NGOs that are commonly published, real-world policy
 experimentation is challenging: researchers need to overcome political
 resistance to randomization and commit to an hands-off approach, even if
 things do not go as planned 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "de2019rise"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Our study is no exception, as the OPM faced various challenges that affected
 the roll-out of the intervention, including budgetary constraints and disruptio
ns related to the general elections of 2016.
 Four years after the baseline survey, with about 50 percent of the planned
 interventions completed, we needed to trade-off waiting for the remaining
 barazas to be implemented and conducting the end-line after partial roll-out.
 We decided to proceed with end-line data collection and employ various
 strategies to diagnose and mitigate problems that may have been introduced
 by the partial roll-out.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find that barazas do not impact public service delivery as measured by
 a pre-registered summary index of various outcomes in four key sectors.
 If we zoom into these sectors, there are signs that sub-county-level barazas
 are effective in the agricultural sector.
 This is in line with recent overview articles, meta-analyses, and replications
 of influential studies on the benefits of community-based monitoring such
 as the one by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "raffler2018weakness"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The emerging consensus is that community-based monitoring can be effective,
 but only if certain conditions are met, and that effects may differ for
 different groups and outcomes.
 For instance, the perceptions of citizens related to the intentions and
 legitimacy of the organizing entity may affect impact 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "doi:10.1080/00220388.2015.1134778"

\end_inset

 Furthermore, individuals must have both the power and incentives to act
 on information they receive during interactions with officials 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "KOSEC2020104376"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Effects on some outcomes (such as citizen engagement) may be stronger than
 effects on other outcomes (such as child mortality), depending on where
 in the causal chain impact is measured and on the scope for further improvement
 in the outcome 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "raffler2018weakness"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Building on this literature, we look at potential reasons why barazas are
 not more effective in our specific case.
 We start by exploring the theory of change behind the baraza program, such
 as the alignment of priorities between citizens and officials, and the
 subsequent translation of priorities into strategies and actions.
 We then discuss how the political context in which community-based monitoring
 is embedded can affect effectiveness and point to various red flags in
 the Ugandan case.
 Finally, we point out methodological challenges inherent to the evaluation
 of interventions where interactions between citizens and government officials
 lead to treatment heterogeneity (as opposed to the theoretical ideal where
 experimental units are assumed to be passive recipients of a uniform and
 homogeneous treatment) and argue that this heterogeneity is likely to dilute
 average treatment effects.

 Until today, all Kenyan chiefs are required by law to convene at least

\begin_layout Standard
The above shows that barazas have a long history in the region.
 The attempt of the Government of Uganda to leverage such an important instituti
on to increase its own effectiveness is interesting and may lead to quite
 different outcomes than other community monitoring interventions.
 At the same time, community fora organized by the government may crowd
 out or even replace alternative community fora that are potentially more
 inclusive and more critical of those in power.

\begin_layout Standard
In the mid-1980s, after attaining relative stability, the Government of
 Uganda, supported by development partners, initiated far reaching liberalizatio
n efforts and introduced a decentralized system of governance, in which
 district and sub-county administrations received considerable responsibilities
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "francis2003balancing"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 This process was assumed to bring representative governance closer to the
 people and to align public services to citizen needs.
 However, two decades after these ambitious reforms, public services in
 Uganda continued to be characterized by misaligned priorities, substandard
 services, elite capture, ineffective monitoring, and weak accountability
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "reinikka2004local"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In response to this, the Government of Uganda, under the stewardship of
 the OPM, initiated community-based monitoring and accountability fora (or
 barazas) with the general objective of “enhancing public involvement in
 holding the government accountable for service delivery in relation to
 the resources spent” 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "New1"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 Barazas were conceived as platforms that enhance information sharing between
 policy makers (the client), public service providers (the implementer),
 and beneficiaries of public goods and services (the users).
 In addition, barazas were designed to provide users with an opportunity
 to ask questions to the client and the implementer and to deliberate among
 themselves.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Barazas were piloted in the financial year 2009/2010.
 Since then, efforts have been underway to roll out barazas in all sub-counties
 in the country.
 By the last quarter of the 2011/2012 financial year, 267 of the country's
 total 1,340 sub-counties, spread over 112 districts, had held a baraza
 meeting.
 At the beginning of 2012/2013, however, changes in implementation were
 suggested: subsequent barazas would target districts instead of sub-counties
 to accelerate roll-out, increase participation at a higher jurisdictional
 level, and reduce costs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A typical baraza meeting is initiated from the center, with the OPM mobilizing
 district and sub-county officials.
 These include the Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) as the head of public
 service providers at the district level, the Resident District Commissioner
 (RDC) as a direct representative of the president, the District Local Council
 chairperson (LC5) as the representative of political leadership at the
 district level, and the sector heads responsible for public services in
 each sector (agriculture, education, infrastructure, and health).
 For sub-county-level barazas, the equivalent of the CAO at the sub-county
 level (the sub-county chief) and the Sub-county Local Council chairperson
 (LC3) also have important roles.
 The OPM, in consultation with the district leaders (RDC, CAO, and LC5)
 and other stakeholders, agrees on a date and a neutral location.
 Again, in consultation with the district leaders, viable moderators are
 identified to guide the baraza forum.
 Village mobilizers and community resource persons publicize the event.
 These community mobilization efforts are further reinforced by adverts
 in the local media in the form of radio announcements, printed banners,
 posters and fliers, and mobile public address systems, a few days before
 the baraza event.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A baraza meeting is chaired by the RDC's office.
 In front of the audience, including local citizens, invited opinion leaders,
 elders, and journalists, the moderators seek feedback from the head of
 each major sector (agriculture, education, health, and infrastructure).
 Sector heads present which services were planned to be delivered in the
 sub-county (or district for district-level barazas), which services were
 actually delivered, which issues and challenges have emerged, and what
 is the way forward.
 The moderators then seek feedback from citizens on whether what has been
 presented is what they understand was planned and actually implemented.
 Sector heads are then given another opportunity to clarify, or react to,
 any issues raised by the citizens.
 At the end of the process, a report to the OPM is prepared, indicating
 issues that arose in the baraza meeting.
 This report points out policy and program implementation weaknesses and
 challenges, which is expected to further feed into the general government
 performance management system.
 Usually, a minister of state is also present at the baraza.
 Baraza events often become emotional and attract considerable media attention,
 also from national newspapers.

Impact of (sub-county-level) barazas
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The baraza intervention is a community-based monitoring intervention that
 combines the provision of information with the opportunity for citizens
 to engage with each other and with decision makers at a local level.
 Community-based monitoring has become a popular tool to improve public
 service delivery.
 However, not all interventions seem to achieve success 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "olken2007monitoring,waddington2019citizen"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 A key question is therefore related to the effectiveness of a typical baraza
 intervention as originally conceived and organized by the OPM.
 We thus first test the impact of sub-county-level barazas that combine
 information provision with a deliberation component on public service delivery
 and associated outcomes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is reasonable to expect meaningful interactions between the information
 and deliberation components of a baraza.
 For example, in a generic baraza, the information component is primarily
 designed to inform citizens about the activities of the service providers.
 To some extent, citizens are passive recipients of this information, and
 officials report what they consider relevant, or may even attempt to misreprese
nt the facts.
 If citizens can also engage with policy makers and civil servants, they
 may request information that is relevant to them.
 It may also result in information flows in the opposite direction as government
 officials learn about the priorities and concerns of citizens.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Information mechanism
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The relationship between citizens and government officials is reminiscent
 of the principal-agent problem.
 In essence, there are three players (elected politicians, civil servants,
 and citizens) with only partly overlapping information sets and potentially
 competing interests.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
As the public servant must be responsive to the needs of both the client
 and the community at the same time, the problem can be characterized as
 a multiple or common agency problem, which adds a collective action component
 to the standard principal-agent problem

\end_inset

 Bringing these stakeholders together in town hall-type meetings is assumed
 to reduce information asymmetries and may be an effective way to improve
 the quality of public services by (1) allowing citizens to monitor and
 apply bottom-up pressure on under-performing civil servants and by (2)
 revealing the discrepancy between what was promised and what was actually
 delivered to politicians, increasing top-down pressure on under-performing
 civil servants.
 A second aim of this study is therefore to isolate the effect of the informatio
n provision component within the broader baraza intervention.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is some evidence that channeling information about the quantity, modality,
 and quality of public services, as well as about the investments and policy
 decisions by politicians, bureaucrats, and service providers to citizens,
 can increase their ability to hold leaders accountable and thus improve
 service provision.
 For example,

 cards with program information to targeted beneficiaries increased the
 subsidy they received from a subsidized rice program.
 A recent review of 48 empirical studies on the impact of information on
 governance and service delivery suggests that the availability of information
 alone may not be sufficient.
 Information must be deemed relevant to its recipient, and individuals must
 have both power and incentives to act on the information

 agents, and the role of evidence that supports the positions articulated

 Second, deliberation can distill social choice more effectively than simple

 citizens and between public servants and citizens 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

Baraza interventions can also be distinguished by the administrative level
 at which they are implemented.
 Barazas were originally implemented at the sub-county level, but from 2012
 onwards, many were implemented at the district level.

An average district in Uganda consists of 15 to 20 sub-counties.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 This points to a potential trade-off between achieving breadth of coverage
 (through district-level barazas), and depth of coverage (through sub-county-lev
el barazas).
 While conducting one district-level baraza is likely to be cheaper than
 conducting sub-county-level barazas in all sub-counties in that district,
 it is not clear a priori how these cost savings justify potential reductions
 in effectiveness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whether placement at a higher or lower level is more effective is likely
 to depend on the outcome and the context.
 For instance, it has been argued that engaging small groups can be more
 effective because they can be coordinated more easily, but large groups
 may be preferable if the desired outcome would be enjoyed by a broader
 group

 Furthermore, action may be more likely if an issue is brought by a large
 group instead of a small group of people that complains about a highly
 localized issue

 It may also be that issues highlighted at the local level fall under the
 responsibility of higher-level authorities and vice versa.
 Therefore, a final objective of this study is to assess the impact of district-
level barazas and compare it to the effectiveness of barazas organized at
 the lower sub-county level.

To answer the above research questions, we designed a field experiment that
 covers districts, sub-counties, and households across the four regional
 blocks of Uganda (Northern, Western, Central, and Eastern).
 Each regional block has unique characteristics in terms of ethnicity, geographi
cal and agro-ecological conditions, as well as cultural history.
 As noted in Section

Restricting ourselves to eligible districts and sub-counties has obvious
 consequences for the study population.
 For instance, the three districts that constitute Karamoja, one of the
 poorest and most remote areas located in the northeast of Uganda, had already
 received district-level barazas.
 As a result, this area was excluded from the analysis.
 While the impact evaluation had national coverage, the fact that we evaluate
 an ongoing policy project needs to be kept in mind when interpreting results
 and extrapolating conclusions.

The experiment at the sub-county level was set up as a

 factorial design, so that pooling treatment cells would boost power.
 However, as we find that the interaction effects between the information
 and deliberation treatments are often important, we estimate fully saturated
 models as explained in the results section.
 As a result, the design at the sub-county level is equivalent to a parallel
 design with a control group, an information only group, a deliberation
 only group and an information+deliberation group.

 We also took a random sample of sub-counties from the 
\begin_inset Formula $D^{ID}$

 Within each sub-county, we randomly sampled five villages, and in each
 village, we randomly selected 10 households.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To determine the number of districts, sub-counties, and households to include
 in the study, we ran an extensive series of power calculations using data
 from the Uganda National Household Survey of 2009/2010 and the Demographic
 and Health Survey of 2011 to estimate standard errors of and correlations
 between the outcome variables.
 In Online Appendix A.1, we show summary statistics for a range of characteristic
s of about 12,500 households that were included in the study, collected
 between June and September 2015.
 We also test for baseline balance between the different treatment groups
 in the original design.
 While we find significant differences for three out of 40 comparisons,
 we do not think that this indicates structural imbalance.

Treatments

The treatments are based on barazas as designed and implemented by the governmen

 A generic sub-county-level baraza was already described in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
 From such a generic baraza, we either removed the information component
 or the deliberation component to test their relative importance.
 To standardize the treatments, we developed detailed scripts that RDCs
 and facilitators were expected to follow, and invited them for training.
 We will summarize the main differences between an information baraza and
 a deliberation baraza in this section.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For information barazas, templates to gather information were filled by
 officials and posted in central locations in each parish of the sub-county
 (or district for district-level barazas) two weeks before the baraza event
 took place.
 The template was designed to inform citizens about planned and actual public
 expenditures in the previous fiscal year, about achievements and challenges
 during that year, and about planned expenditures and targets for the next
 fiscal year.
 This information was provided by the sub-county chief for each of the four
 sectors (agriculture, infrastructure, health, and education).
\begin_inset Foot

While the preparation and distribution of these posters were the responsibility
 of the RDC, there were research assistants that closely monitored the implement

 We also assisted in printing the template posters.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 On the day of the baraza event, the CAO introduced the sector heads and
 gave a brief presentation on the overall budget for the fiscal year, and
 the main achievements and challenges in service delivery.
 After a brief intervention by the OPM, officials responsible for each sector
 presented the information on the templates.
 An information-focused baraza allowed for only 10 clarifying questions,
 to be collected and asked by the facilitator.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For deliberation barazas, posters were also mounted in each parish of the
 sub-county (or district for district-level barazas), but only announced
 that a baraza was going to be held at a particular date and place.
 At the baraza, after a brief introduction by the OPM, citizens were instructed
 to break into four groups by sector, discuss problems they faced and draw
 up a list of priority issues that needed to be addressed.
 Facilitators in each group were expected to focus the discussion on what
 was done well, on the problems citizens encountered during the past year,
 and on what needs to be done in the next fiscal year.
 They were also required to anonymously collect the resulting information.
 After the break-out sessions, officials reacted to the specific comments
 and requests.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A sub-county-level baraza in the crossed treatment group combined both elements.
 District-level barazas were similar to (information and deliberation) sub-count
y-level barazas, except for the fact that they were organized at the district
 headquarters, that the chiefs and LC3's of each sub-county were expected
 to attend in case questions related to their sub-county arose, and that
 all citizens in the district were invited.

Our implementing partner OPM faced substantial challenges in the roll-out
 of sub-county-level barazas.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
All district-level barazas were implemented as planned, therefore this section
 focuses on sub-county-level barazas.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 At the start of 2018, and almost two and a half years after baseline data
 was collected, only about 25 percent of the planned sub-county-level interventi
ons had happened.
 At that point, costs and benefits of waiting until the OPM finished all
 barazas or collecting baseline information despite incomplete roll-out
 were assessed.
 After an additional six months, with still only 56 of 155 sub-county barazas
 done, we decided to collect end-line data before all sub-counties were
 treated, given that the government's financial constraints made it unlikely
 that all barazas would be held anytime soon.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
End-line data collection after partial roll-out will affect statistical
 power.
 More worryingly, it may introduce selection bias in the sub-sample of sub-count
ies that were assigned to the treatment.
 It may be that, from the sub-counties randomly assigned to treatment, particula
r sub-counties were treated first, and others postponed.
 For instance, the implementing partner may have started with sub-counties
 near the capital for logistical reasons, resulting in a treatment group
 that is not directly comparable to the control group.
 Or the OPM may have decided to prioritize sub-counties that perform the
 worst on certain indicators, such as the number of boreholes or student
 enrollment rates.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We acknowledge the partial roll-out as a threat to internal validity that
 should not be ignored.
 At the same time, the fact that we started from a cluster RCT still provides
 substantial advantages over studies that are based on observational data.
 For instance, potential selection emanating from partial roll-out is restricted
 to the sub-sample of sub-counties that was assigned to be treated, substantiall
y reducing the scope for bias.
 In addition, the list of sub-counties to be treated that we shared with
 the implementing partner was organized by treatment group (information,
 deliberation, and combined treatment), and in each treatment group, sub-countie
s were listed alphabetically.
 Looking at this list, we get the impression that the OPM started at the
 top and worked its way down: relatively more sub-counties that were assigned
 to the information baraza were treated, and relatively more sub-counties
 at the top of each treatment group were treated.
 This pattern is confirmed when we regress the likelihood of a sub-county
 being treated on its rank in the list.
 This is a first indication that OPM officials did not deliberately select
 certain sub-counties.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section, we diagnose potential selection bias by assessing baseline
 balance between assigned-to-be-treated-but-not-treated sub-counties and
 control sub-counties.
 We then explain the end-line data collection strategy that further reduces
 potential selection bias: selecting control units by matching them to treatment
 units on a range of sub-county characteristics that may have affected how
 the intervention was rolled out.
 In Online Appendix A.2, we investigate the impact of the partial roll-out
 on statistical power.
 To do so, we use simulation methods to estimate minimum detectable effect
 sizes at different power levels for the reduced sample size associated
 with the partial roll-out and conclude that we maintain reasonable power.
 Online Appendix A.3 further shows that attrition is low and independent
 of the treatment assignment.

\begin_layout Standard
One way to test if selection bias was introduced by the partial roll-out
 is to compare outcomes in sub-counties that were randomly allocated to
 function as controls to outcomes in sub-counties that were randomly allocated
 to receive treatment but did not end up receiving treatment.
 If the roll-out was random, these sub-counties could be interchanged.
 Finding no significant differences between these two groups would therefore
 support the hypothesis that the partial roll-out has not introduced selection
 bias.
 If the incomplete roll-out has introduced selection bias, comparing these
 groups will also be informative to assess the direction and magnitude of
 the bias.
\begin_inset Foot

Alternatively, one could restrict attention to sub-counties that were randomly
 allocated to receive treatment and compare the ones that ended up being
 treated to the ones that did not.

 presents differences between assigned-to-be-treated-but-not-treated sub-countie
s and control sub-counties for each of the three treatment arms affected
 by the partial roll-out.
 It is equivalent to the original balance table (Table A.1 in the Online
 Appendix), but after dropping sub-counties that were actually treated.
 We find that the imbalance related to the distance to the nearest all-weather
 road as shown in Online Appendix Table A.1 becomes more pronounced.
 This may indicate that the OPM prioritized the treatment of areas that
 are less remote.
 Similarly, the imbalance for the number of children in public schools is
 further accentuated, suggesting that information barazas were first organized
 in areas with fewer children in public schools prior to the study.
 At the same time, it should be noted that we only find significant differences
 for comparisons that rejected balance also in the original balance table.

Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 presents the factorial design that underlies the sub-county-level baraza
 impact evaluation.
 It shows that, based on the original power calculations, we planned to
 have between 51 and 53 sub-counties (corresponding to about 2,550 to 2,650
 households) in each treatment cell.
 Just before the end-line data collection, 29 of 51 sub-counties that were
 supposed to receive the information treatment were treated, 18 of 51 sub-counti
es that were supposed to receive the deliberation treatment were treated,
 and 20 of 53 sub-counties that were supposed to receive the crossed (informatio
n + deliberation) treatment were treated.
 All eight districts that were supposed to be treated were treated, from
 which 40 sub-counties (corresponding to about 2,000 households) were sampled.
 Overall, this means that about 55 percent of all sub-counties that were
 planned to receive any form of baraza were treated, corresponding to about
 5,350 households.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Statistical power is optimal when the number of treatment units is equal
 to the number of control units, and while adding more control sub-counties
 will increase power, these gains in power must be weighed against the costs
 of collecting additional data.
 As only a subset of sub-counties that were planned to be treated were treated,
 it would not be cost-effective to collect end-line data in all sub-counties
 that were not treated.
 We decided to collect end-line data in 40 control sub-counties, which is
 equal to the number of sub-counties with a district-level baraza (the largest
 number of sub-counties among the different treatment cells).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This implies that we had to decide in which of the potential control sub-countie
s (including those that were allocated to the control group and those that
 ended up not being treated) we should collect end-line data.
 One reasonable suggestion would be to pick them randomly.
 However, if the roll-out was not random, this strategy may lead to a biased
 estimate of the causal impact of the intervention.
 For instance, if the OPM prioritized the treatment of less remote areas,
 randomly selecting control sub-counties may result in a sample in which
 less remote sub-counties are relatively under-represented and more remote
 sub-counties are relatively over-represented in the control group.
 A better strategy may involve matching each treated sub-county with a control
 sub-county that exhibits similar pre-treatment characteristics, which the
 planner was likely to know or have access to during the intervention roll-out.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We matched each treated sub-county to a control sub-county that was similar
 in terms of a range of sub-county characteristics that may have affected
 the planner's decision how to roll out the intervention.
 In particular, we match on the following characteristics that were obtained
 by surveying village chairs and CAOs of all sub-counties at baseline: geographi
c location (GPS coordinates of the headquarter), road infrastructure (kilometers
 of tarmac and all-weather gravel roads), share of households with electricity,
 share of households with an iron roof or tiles, number of health centers,
 female primary school dropout rate, number of Universal Primary Education
 schools, share of farmers using improved seed, and political connections
 of the sub-county (defined as having a minister or member of parliament
 coming from the sub-county).
 These characteristics are used in a probit regression to predict the probabilit
y that a sub-county is treated.
 We then match each treated sub-county to a candidate control sub-county
 that is closest in terms of the predicted probability of being treated.
 Note that we completed the matching before collecting end-line data and

 Two significant differences in 40 comparisons can be expected from chance
 alone, and based on this, we conclude that we maintain balance between
 the treatment and control groups in the final sample.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the ex-ante matching strategy may reduce bias resulting from incomplete
 roll-out, it may come at a cost.
 First, if the roll-out introduced selection, matching may further reduce
 the external validity of the study, as now also the control sub-counties
 are not a random sample of the study population anymore.
 Second, the decrease in potential bias for hypotheses related to sub-county-lev
el barazas should be traded off against an increase in potential bias when
 testing differences between district-level barazas and control.
 As the sub-county-level analysis weighs higher in terms of research objectives,
 we decided to prioritize the reduction in potential bias at this level.
 However, both issues are only relevant if selection bias was introduced
 due to the partial roll-out.

These indices are weighted means of the standardized values of the outcome

 The weights maximize the amount of information captured in the index by
 giving less weight to outcomes that are highly correlated with each other.
 The variables that are included in the sector indices can be found in Tables

 The use of indices is considered to be an effective strategy to account

 In light of the shift from sub-county-level barazas to district-level barazas
 from 2012 on, this comparison is more relevant from a policy perspective,
 and it was also pre-registered.

 the relative effectiveness of the information component, the relative effective
ness of the deliberation component, and the impact of district-level barazas—on
 four sectors: agriculture, infrastructure, health, and education.
 As mentioned above, these graphs are based on indices that are composed
 of various outcomes in each sector according to

This method first reconstructs a complete schedule of potential outcomes
 by adding and subtracting the average treatment effect for control and
 treatment units respectively.
 These potential outcomes are then used to simulate all possible random
 allocations.
 For each allocation, average treatment effects are estimated and 2.5th and
 97.5th percentiles are taken as the lower and upper limits of the 95 percent
 confidence interval.
 As this provides a conservative estimate of the confidence interval, it
 may be that results in the graph appear insignificant, but show up as significa
nt when testing significance using Fisher's exact test in the tables in
 Online Appendix A.4.

 We also combine the four indices in one overall index that assesses the
 impact on public service delivery in general.
 We do not find any significant impact of the baraza program on overall
 public service delivery.
 There are some indications that sub-county-level barazas improved public
 services in the agricultural sector, although only significant at the 10
 percent level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The indices combine various outcome variables, and for some of them the
 expected direction of the effect is unclear a priori.
 For instance, an information baraza may improve the quality of services
 in a hospital or health center when judged by an objective measure such
 as waiting time.
 However, the information may also result in higher expectations from the
 users.
 As such, citizen perceptions of quality may have reduced as a result of
 information barazas.
 That is why it is also interesting to look beyond the indices and consider
 outcomes individually.
 In Online Appendix A.4, we provide a detailed and more exploratory analysis
 of the individual outcomes behind the indices, and of some other outcomes
 that were not pre-registered.
 This analysis suggests a minor impact of sub-county-level barazas in some
 areas (such as schooling infrastructure or waiting time at boreholes).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main conclusion from our confirmatory analysis is in line with what
 many other studies find: we do not measure a significant impact of the
 baraza policy program as a form of community-based monitoring on public
 service delivery as a whole 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "olken2007monitoring,raffler2018weakness,waddington2019citizen"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 In this section, we explore some of the potential reasons why barazas do
 not seem to translate into large overall or sector-wide improvements in
 public services.
 We categorize these explanations under three headings: problems with the
 theory of change, the political context in which the program was implemented,
 and methodological challenges in evaluating real world policy interventions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Problems with the theory of change
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Community-based monitoring interventions such as the baraza program can
 only improve public service delivery if there is room for improvement:
 if politicians are already responsive to the needs of citizens and civil
 servants are already delivering services of high quality, it would be unlikely
 that barazas have any significant additional effect on objectively verifiable
 outcomes such as waiting time in health centers or student-teacher ratios
 (however, they could still change citizen perceptions of public service
 delivery—see below).
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Indeed, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "raffler2018weakness"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 argue that child mortality decreased significantly in response to the community
-based monitoring intervention in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "bjorkman2009power"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 but not in their study is likely due to the fact that child mortality improved
 substantially over the last few decades, leaving little room for further
 improvement.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 We think it is hard to argue that public services in Uganda cannot be improved.
 While progress has been made in some areas such as child mortality, other
 areas have seen less improvement.
 For instance, only about 10 percent of households report that they have
 access to agricultural extension, see Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Balance_planed_ctrl"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 Baseline data further shows that patients at government health centers
 must wait for medical examination for almost two hours on average and are
 examined by a nurse instead of a doctor in many cases.
 Access to water remains problematic, especially in the dry season when
 36 percent of households turn to potentially unsafe drinking water.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Alternatively, if there are no funds available for public service delivery,
 community-based monitoring will most likely not lead to the desired outcomes.
 Again, we think that a lack of funding is not the main problem.
 The liberalization and decentralization drive in the mid-eighties seduced
 donors across the globe to pour money into Ugandan public services.
 While some studies report rampant elite capture 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
before "for example,"
key "reinikka2004local"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, we asked government officials in all sub-counties of our sample at baseline
 about the proportion of their public service budget that they actually
 received for the fiscal year 2013/2014, and they reported to have received
 on average 83 percent of their health and education budgets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The impact of the baraza program will also likely be muted if the priorities
 of politicians and civil servants are not aligned with the priorities of
 citizens.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Note that unaligned priorities cannot fully explain why barazas have no
 effect: services may still improve, but in sectors which are not most important
 for citizens.
 However, assuming that citizens know well where progress can be made, unaligned
 priorities will reduce the effectiveness of barazas.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 For priorities to be aligned, it is important that what is discussed during
 barazas is also what citizens think is most important.
 This is not automatically the case, as the most vocal citizens may dominate
 the discussion due to group dynamics and attempt to skew decisions during
 the meeting in their favor.
 Alternatively, politicians or civil servants could influence the course
 of the baraza.
 We explore the alignment between what citizens perceive as important and
 what transpires during the baraza for 10 random sub-counties in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Alignment"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 To this end, we use baseline data on priorities obtained from citizens
 living in a sub-county (column 3) and compare it to detailed information
 about which sector was most discussed during each sub-county-level baraza
 using reports redacted by the OPM (column 4).
 We find that what is prioritized by citizens is also discussed in the baraza
 in four out of 10 sub-counties, providing indicative evidence of some degree
 of alignment between what citizens deem important and what is discussed
 during barazas.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even if what transpires during barazas reflects the priorities of citizens,
 there will be no impact if officials subsequently do not act on it.
 To explore this link in the causal impact chain, we add a column that reports
 in which sector most positive change was recorded during end-line for each
 of the 10 sub-counties to Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Alignment"
plural "false"

\end_inset

.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This is based on the indices that we created earlier to measure the impact
 at sector level (see Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Results"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\end_inset

 We find that in only two out of 10 sub-counties, the sector that was discussed
 most during the baraza event was also the sector where most change was
 recorded.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Alignment"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 suggests that even though the priorities of citizens are to some extent
 discussed during barazas, it is not common that what was decided gets implement
ed.
 Using focus group discussions, we looked for reasons why this link breaks
 down.
 Firstly, poor relationships between politicians and technical personnel
 can hinder the effectiveness of barazas.
 For example, a poor relation or communication between a CAO and a LC5 Chairpers
on can impede public service delivery.
 Secondly, if barazas mainly expose issues beyond the accountability of
 the officials and service providers that are present, they will not improve
 services.
 Some issues fall under the responsibility of higher levels of government
 or other institutions that are beyond the operational jurisdiction of the
 people present at barazas.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thirdly, if barazas are perceived as one-off events and no subsequent meetings
 are organized in the same area, officials may be less likely to implement
 what was decided.
 Optimism among citizens and other stakeholders can quickly turn into disappoint
ment if none of the issues raised is addressed.
 To investigate the role of the timing of the intervention, we reran the
 analysis and added an interaction term between the treatment indicator
 and an indicator variable that takes the value of one if the baraza that
 the household was exposed to had happened more than one and a half years
 before the end-line data collection.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The slow roll-out of the intervention introduced variation in the time that
 passed between treatment and end-line data collection.
 For instance, the first barazas were held around June 2016, so that more
 than three years have passed between treatment and end-line.
 For the most recent barazas, there are only a few months between treatment
 and end-line.
 The indicator is coded as zero for the control group.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Results are summarized in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Heterogeneity-time"

\end_inset

 and show that the effects of barazas dissipate over time, especially for
 infrastructure and health.
 This suggests that the policy program is not effective because barazas
 are not organized more frequently and enthusiasm fades, plans are abandoned,
 and promises forgotten over time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Political context
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The political environment in which barazas are organized may also affect
 their effectiveness.
 Indeed, drawing on a systematic review of more than 90 social accountability
 interventions, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "doi:10.1080/00220388.2015.1134778"

\end_inset

 argue that politics and contexts are critical for success.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "raffler2018weakness"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 note that citizens can only apply bottom-up pressure on political representativ
es if they are responsive to electoral pressure and that this condition
 is often not fulfilled in countries with uncompetitive, semi-democratic
 political systems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Barazas are organized by the OPM and several officials who belong to this
 office have appeared in the news in the context of large corruption scandals
 over the last decade.
 We also saw in Subsection 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Ugandan-baraza-program"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 that the meetings are chaired by the RDC's office.
 RDCs are direct representatives and appointees of the president, and this
 may affect how the public views barazas.
 Some may even argue that barazas cannot be characterized as a form of community
-based monitoring or any collective bottom-up action at all because they
 are helicoptered into communities by the OPM and to some extent impose
 interactions between citizens, politicians, and civil servants.
 Instead, some groups in society (for example, supporters of the opposition)
 may not perceive barazas as open fora but as highly politicized events,
 especially in comparison to the 
\emph on
ebimeeza
\emph default
 meetings which the government banned when the baraza program was rolled
 out (see Subsection 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "2.1 Nature of the baraza institution"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 Government officials may abuse the meetings to pursue their own agenda,
 and indeed, some reports indicate that barazas turned into political rallies,
 especially when elections were approaching.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To explore the importance of the political context and how the program was
 received in pro-government and pro-opposition areas, we look at treatment
 heterogeneity related to a sub-county's connection to people in power.
 The assumption is that a sub-county is more likely to be pro-government
 if it delivers higher-level politicians, such as ministers, members of
 parliament, heads of government agencies, RDCs, and other district- or
 central-level officials.
 One may expect that in these areas, barazas are more effective, since citizens
 can use their connections to the center to attract funding to issues raised,
 and politicians may want to reward their constituents.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:connections"

\end_inset

 reports interaction effects between the different interventions and an
 indicator variable that takes the value of one if a sub-county is well
 connected to people in power.
 Based on the indices, we do not find significant interactions.
 However, coefficients are generally positive, especially for interactions
 with deliberation and district-level barazas.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Methodological issues
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We provided a detailed description of the implementation challenges surrounding
 the baraza program in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Implementation-challenges-and"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 We also argued that the primary concerns related to the partial roll-out,
 namely reduced statistical power and potentially selective roll-out, are
 unlikely to affect our conclusions.
 In this sub-section, we focus on treatment heterogeneity as a potential
 reason why we do not find more convincing effects.
 Focus group discussions with citizens indicated that barazas were often
 perceived as effective: they provided different examples of changes in
 public services that they thought were due to, or accelerated by, the baraza
 event.
 Their stories suggest that the impact of barazas on public service delivery
 may be highly localized and context specific.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And indeed, barazas are fairly broad interventions that attempt to address
 a range of issues in heterogeneous settings, resulting in interventions
 that are unlikely to be standardized across treatment units, at least compared
 to typical treatments in biomedical sciences 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "https://doi.org/10.1093/aepp/ppq023"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 For example, a baraza in one sub-county may lead to significant improvements
 in smallholder access to extension services, but to no improvements in
 infrastructure.
 A baraza in another sub-county may accelerate the construction of an all-weathe
r gravel road but agricultural public services remain the same.
 Both barazas would be effective, yet outcomes are averaged over treatment
 units, and impact may be diluted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This could be an alternative explanation why we do not find an overall impact
 on public service delivery, even though many of the effects we measure
 go in the expected direction, and we do find some significant effects when
 we consider individual outcomes in a more exploratory analysis in Online
 Appendix A.4.
 Heterogeneous treatment effects have been documented in similar community-based
 monitoring interventions, complicating the estimation of average treatment
 effects

\begin_layout Section
Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To improve governance and public service delivery in Uganda, the OPM organizes
 town hall-style meetings—popularly known as barazas—where citizens receive
 information from government officials and get the opportunity to engage
 with them.
 In 2015, we designed a cluster RCT aimed at evaluating the effectiveness
 of this large-scale, high-profile policy intervention.
 The study set out to answer four research questions: (1) What is the impact
 of a baraza as originally conceived and implemented by the OPM? (2) What
 is the relative importance of the information component of a baraza? (3)
 What is the relative importance of the deliberation component of a baraza?
 (4) Should a baraza be organized at the district level or at the sub-county
 level? Baseline data from more than 12,500 households spread over almost
 250 sub-counties in about 40 districts throughout Uganda was collected
 and the OPM started implementing barazas following our experimental design
 and protocols.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The OPM faced various challenges that affected the timely roll-out of the
 barazas, including budgetary constraints and disruptions related to the
 general elections of 2016, which resulted in the decision to collect end-line
 information from 6,700 households after partial roll-out.
 This paper therefore also serves as an illustration of the challenges of
 evaluating real-world policy interventions and how to deal with them, as
 we follow various strategies to diagnose, and reduce the consequences of,
 potential selection bias and sample size reduction.
 We find that the partial roll-out did not introduce significant bias and
 that we retain sufficient statistical power.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Judged by an index of overall public service delivery, we find no significant
 impact of the program.
 There are indications that sub-county-level barazas improved service delivery
 in the agricultural sector.
 We then consider various potential reasons why barazas did not have the
 expected sector-wide benefits.
 We find indications of problems in the theory of change: while priorities
 of citizens do seem to get discussed during barazas, solutions are not
 always implemented.
 Furthermore, the political context in which barazas are organized is likely
 to affect their effectiveness.
 We also reflect on the heterogeneity of community-based monitoring intervention
s, complicating the estimation of average treatment effects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our findings are in line with a recent study by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "raffler2018weakness"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 that failed to replicate 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "bjorkman2009power"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 In general, initial high hopes about the potential of community engagement
 to improve public service delivery seems to have lowered as more empirical
 evidence becomes available.
 In a recent mixed-methods systematic review of participation, inclusion,
 transparency and accountability (PITA) initiatives, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "waddington2019citizen"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 suggest that citizen engagement may have positive effects on intermediate
 user engagement outcomes such as meeting attendance, access to, and quality
 of certain public services.
 At the same time, effects on public service outcomes such as education
 or child health are often limited.
 In many cases, citizen participation also does not lead to changes in service
 provider action outcomes such as public spending, staff motivation, and
 corruption.
 More research is needed to identify the conditions and complementary interventi
ons needed to leverage the voices of citizens.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When we asked the OPM if our findings affected the program as it is organized
 today, they informed us that they now follow a blended strategy of sub-county-
 and district-level barazas, but that the pandemic hindered the implementation
 process.
