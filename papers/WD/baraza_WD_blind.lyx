\begin_layout Title
The impact of community-based monitoring on public service delivery: A randomize
d control trial in Uganda
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
In many developing countries, poor delivery of public services remains an
 important problem.
 Through community-based monitoring, beneficiaries of public services can
 apply bottom-up pressure to under-performing service providers and their
 political leadership.
 In this spirit, the Government of Uganda organizes community forums—popularly
 known as barazas—where citizens receive information from government officials
 and get the opportunity to challenge them.
 We designed a cluster randomized control trial to assess the impact of
 this policy intervention on public service delivery in agriculture, health,
 education, and infrastructure.
 We further test the relative importance of the two main components of the
 intervention—information provision and citizen engagement.
 We also compare the effectiveness of barazas organized at the district
 level to the effectiveness of barazas organized at the sub-county level.
 Following a pre-specified confirmatory analysis, we do not find that the
 intervention had significant effects on general public service delivery,
 though there are signs of improvement in agricultural sector public services.
 We also find that the provision of information reduces in-kind contributions
 and increases cash contributions.
 A more exploratory analysis suggests that sub-county level barazas lead
 to improved drinking water and schooling infrastructure.
 Furthermore, barazas seem particularly effective for households in remote
 areas and may be an important catalyst to organize communities around public
 infrastructure in the absence of social cohesion.
 The fact that results are slightly more encouraging than similar community
 monitoring initiatives by non-governmental organizations may indicate that
 top-down monitoring may be more important in changing behavior of civil
 servants, but that bottom-up pressure from the community may be an effective
 way to pressure officials into increased top-down monitoring.
 We conclude that organizing barazas more frequently may increase the likelihood
 that officials implement what was decided upon during the events.

In many developing countries, poor delivery of public services remains problemat
ic.
 Public infrastructure, such as roads or boreholes for drinking water, is
 poor.
 The quality of service provided in hospitals and schools is low.
 Absenteeism and corruption are endemic.
 This is also the case in Uganda, where the public service sector suffers
 from high levels of elite capture, ineffective monitoring and weak accountabili
ty 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "reinikka2004local"

\end_inset

.
 In response to this, the baraza program, an initiative of the president
 of Uganda and implemented by the Office of the Prime Minister (OPM), was
 designed to improve public service delivery by enhancing public involvement
 in holding the government accountable for service delivery in relation
 to resources spent 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "New1"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 The program brings politicians, civil servants and citizens together in
 town-hall type meetings (barazas) to share information and engage with
 each other.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since 2009, barazas have been organized in sub-counties throughout Uganda.
 However, up to now, no rigorous impact evaluation was undertaken.
 A first objective of this paper is thus to assess if the program had an
 impact on public service delivery and associated outcomes.
 Furthermore, in 2012, the decision was made to organize subsequent barazas
 at higher administrative levels (district) instead of the sub-county level,
 mainly to reduce cost and speed up roll-out.
 A second mayor objective of this study was to inform policy makers on the
 consequences of this change in terms of effectiveness of the program.
 A third objective of the study was to assess the relative importance of
 the two main components of a generic baraza event and differentiate between,
 on the one hand, the impact of arming citizens with information related
 to budgeting and spending, and, on the other hand, the impact of allowing
 citizens to engage with public servants and politicians in moderated questions-
and-answers sessions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our study also serves as an illustration of the challenges of evaluating
 real world policy interventions and how to deal with them.
 While we feel that field experiments of large policy interventions provide
 greater external validity than the carefully designed experiments implemented
 by closely monitored non-governmental organizations (NGOs) we see in the
 literature these days, real-world policy experimentation is challenging:
 Political resistance to randomization needs to be overcome and researchers
 need to commit to an off-hands approach, even if things go not entirely
 as planned 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "de2019rise"

\end_inset

.
 Our study was no exception, as the OPM faced various challenges that affected
 the roll-out of the intervention, including budgetary constraints and disruptio
ns related to the general elections of 2016.
 Four years after the baseline survey, with about 50 percent of the planned
 interventions completed, a trade-off needed to be made between waiting
 for the remaining barazas to be completed or conducting the end-line after
 partial roll-out.
 It was decided to proceed with end-line data collection and employ various
 strategies to diagnose and mitigate problems that may have been introduced
 by the partial roll-out.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When we strictly follow our pre-analysis plan, we find no overall impact
 of the baraza program.
 When looking at outcomes aggregated at the sector level, we find some evidence
 that sub-county level barazas had a positive impact on public service delivery
 in the agricultural sector, and this impact is clearly larger than the
 (lack of) impact associated with district level barazas.
 Looking at various outcomes in each of the four sectors in more detail
 in a more exploratory analysis, we see that the overall impact in the agricultu
ral sector is driven by the deliberative component of sub-county level barazas,
 which induces farmers to organize themselves in associations and cooperatives,
 allowing them better access to government provided agricultural inputs
 and advisory services.
 The sector level aggregate outcomes also seem to hide significant impacts
 of sub-county level barazas on access to drinking water and schooling infrastru
cture.
 Further inquiry into some of the mechanisms suggests that the information
 component of barazas reduces in-kind contributions and increases cash contribut
ions, which suggests that barazas increase trust in officials and strengthen
 the social contract.
 There are also signs that the aggregate treatment effects mask significant
 heterogeneity.
 In particular, if we exploit the variation in the timing of the interventions,
 we find that the effectiveness of barazas seems to dissipate over time.
 We also find that barazas may be an important catalyst to organize communities
 around public infrastructure in the absence of social cohesion due to ethnic
 fractionalization, and that barazas may be particularly effective for household
s that live in remote areas.

\begin_layout Standard
There are several studies that look at the impact of community-based monitoring
 on public service delivery, many of them using Uganda as a case.
 A landmark study is 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, who analyze the impact of a community driven local accountability project
 in primary health care provision in Uganda.
 They find that community-based monitoring resulted in significant improvements
 in health care delivery, utilization, and health outcomes (most notably
 child mortality and weight-for-age z-scores) after one year, and confirm
 in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "bjorkman2017experimental"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 that these effects also hold in the longer run.
 More recently, however, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 come to different conclusions when testing an intervention closely modeled
 on the one of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "bjorkman2009power"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 and in a similar setting.
 The study, involving a three-wave panel of more than 14,000 households,
 shows that the intervention was able to change the behavior of public service
 providers.
 However, it did not find that the intervention directly increased community
 monitoring, nor generated improvements in health outcomes, at least in
 the short run.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our study contributes to this literature in various ways.
 First, it is one of few studies that considers the role of jurisdictional
 tier on the effectiveness of community-based monitoring.
 The level at which the town-hall meetings are organized may affect its
 effectiveness in potentially opposing ways: Interventions at a more local
 level may result in more relevant issues being scrutinized.
 However, qualitative explorations suggest that, often, issues raised in
 lower level barazas were beyond the operational jurisdiction of the officials
 that were present at the baraza 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "van2018impact"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 This may be less of a problem when barazas are organized at district level.
 Most other studies consider interventions that were placed at local jurisdictio
nal levels.
 For instance, the intervention in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "raffler2018weakness"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 was implemented in health centers and their associated catchment areas,
 defined as the three villages closest to the health center.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Second, our study evaluates the impact of a large-scale, high-profile policy
 intervention that receives broad support within government, among opinion
 leaders and among citizens in Uganda.
 Such interventions may instigate an entirely different set of dynamics
 than interventions that are organized by local or international NGOs (as
 is the case in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "bjorkman2009power"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "raffler2018weakness"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 For instance, many of the actors involved may find that NGOs are not mandated
 when it comes to public services such as health and education.
 This is also consistent with suggestive evidence in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "raffler2018weakness"
literal "true"

\end_inset

, who found that the presence of sub-county officials during their community-bas
ed monitoring intervention boosted the impact of the intervention.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Third, barazas take a comprehensive, multi-sector approach, enabling cross-secto
ral planning and potentially allowing for re-allocation of resources across
 sectors to better align with problems that were identified during barazas.
 Some of the problems most mentioned by users, such hygiene in health centers
 or accessibility, involve cooperation between heads of different sectors
 (for example, health and infrastructure to get access to water in health
 centers).
 Bringing civil servants from different sectors together and confronting
 them with the priorities of citizens may increase information sharing and
 cooperation between them.
 Most other studies focus on a single sector; health in particular seems
 to be a popular sector for community monitoring interventions

 this for the study, and the strategies used to test and deal with it.
 This is followed by a section presents results, starting with a summary

 is a Swahili word that refers to a set of places where people meet (for
 example, a veranda in front of a house or some benches under a simple shelter

 simple informal assemblies to formal councils

 Throughout East Africa, barazas are traditional forms of community assemblies

 In Zanzibar, they are essential features of the social discourse and have
 facilitated discussions ranging from local deliberations and disputes to
 international matters.
 Here, barazas facilitate negotiations of all kinds and serve to share informati

 They can be public or private, formal or informal but often follow a distinct
 set of rules and a particular code of behavior

 In Burundi, barazas have traditionally been used to settle differences
 and discuss community issues.
 In Tanzania, barazas include formal councils and corporations like the

 News Broadcast Corporation "Baraza la Habari Tanzania"

 In Kenya, barazas refer to assemblies where politicians and bureaucrats
 present themselves to citizens on a public stage.
 These meetings are usually held outdoors, individually licensed by the
 state, and range in size from smaller gatherings to large assemblies with
 several thousand participants who are addressed by the president

 Kenyan barazas used to be the main meeting ground between "the ruled" ordinary
 citizens on the one hand, and state officials and bureaucrats as "the rulers"
 on the other hand.
 While some barazas only serve to legitimize a provincial political ideology
 or aim at pro forma popular consensus, others lead to honest and real debates
 between citizens and politicians

 Until today, all Kenyan chiefs are required by law to convene at least

The above shows that the baraza as an institution has a long history in
 the region.
 The attempt of the government of Uganda to leverage such an important instituti
on to increase effectiveness of its own functioning is interesting, and
 may lead to quite different outcomes than other community monitoring interventi
ons.

Ugandan baraza program
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the mid-1980s, after attaining relative stability, the Government of
 Uganda, supported by development partners, initiated far reaching liberalizatio
n efforts and introduced a decentralized system of governance, in which
 district and sub-county administrations received considerable responsibilities
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "francis2003balancing"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 It was assumed that this process would lead to the formulation of public
 services that were more aligned to citizens' needs and bring representative
 governance closer to citizens.
 However, two decades after these ambitious reforms, public services in
 Uganda continued to be characterized by misaligned priorities, substandard
 services, elite capture, ineffective monitoring, and weak accountability
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "reinikka2004local"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In response to this, the Government of Uganda, under the stewardship of
 the OPM, initiated community-based monitoring and accountability fora (or
 citizen barazas) in 2009 with the general objective of “enhancing public
 involvement in holding the government accountable for service delivery
 in relation to the resources spent” 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "New1"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 Barazas were conceived as platforms for enhancing information sharing between
 policy makers (the client), public servants (the implementer), and beneficiarie
s of public goods and services (the users).
 In addition, barazas were designed to provide the opportunity to users
 to ask questions to the policy makers and public service providers and
 deliberate among themselves.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Barazas were first piloted in the financial year 2009/10.
 Since then, efforts have been underway to roll out barazas in all sub-counties
 in the country.
 By the last quarter of the 2011/2012 financial year, 267 out of the country’s
 total of 1,340 sub-counties, spread over 112 districts, had held a baraza
 meeting.
 At the beginning of 2012/2013, however, changes in implementation were
 suggested: subsequent barazas would target districts instead of sub-counties
 to accelerate roll-out, increase participation at a higher jurisdictional
 level, and reduce costs.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A typical baraza meeting is initiated from the center, with the OPM mobilizing
 district and sub-county officials.
 These include the Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) as the head of public
 service providers at the district level, the Resident District Commissioner
 (RDC) as a direct representative of the president, the District Local Council
 chairperson (LC5) as the representative of political leadership at the
 district level, and the various sector heads responsible for public services
 in each sector (agriculture, education, infrastructure, and health).
 For sub-county level barazas, the sub-county level equivalents of the CAO
 (the sub-county chief) and the Sub-county Local Council chairperson (LC3)
 also have important roles.
 The OPM, in consultation with the district leaders (RDC, CAO and the LC5)
 and other stakeholders, agrees on the date and a neutral location.
 Again, in consultation with the district leaders, viable moderators are
 identified to guide the baraza forum.
 Village mobilizers and community resource persons are used to publicize
 the event.
 These community mobilization efforts are further reinforced by adverts
 in the local media in the form of radio announcements, printed banners,
 posters and fliers, and mobile public address systems, a few days before
 the baraza event.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A baraza meeting is chaired by the Office of the RDC in each district.
 In front of the audience, including local citizens, invited opinion leaders,
 elders, and journalists, the moderators seek feedback from each head of
 major sectors (agriculture, education, health, infrastructure).
 Sector heads are required to present what services were planned to be delivered
 in the sub-county (or district for district level barazas), what was actually
 delivered and in what quantity and quality, and what issues and challenges
 have emerged and what is the way forward.
 The moderators then seek feedback from citizens on whether what has been
 presented is what they understand was planned for and actually implemented
 in different locations.
 Sector heads are then given another opportunity to clarify on, or react
 to, any issues raised by the citizens.
 At the end of the process, a report to the OPM is prepared, indicating
 issues that arose in the baraza meeting.
 This report particularly points out policy and program implementation weaknesse
s and challenges, which is then expected to further feed into the general
 government performance management system.
 Usually, a minister of state is also present at the baraza.
 Baraza events often become very emotional, and the events attract considerable
 media attention, also from national newspapers.

Impact of (sub-county level) barazas
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The baraza intervention as conceived by the OPM is a standard community-based
 monitoring intervention that combines the provision of information with
 the opportunity for citizens to engage with each other and with decision
 makers at a local level.
 Such community-based monitoring has become a popular tool to improve service
 delivery.
 However, not all such interventions appear to be successful 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "waddington2019citizen,olken2007monitoring"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 A key question is therefore simply related to the impact of a typical baraza
 intervention as originally conceived and organized by the OPM.
 We thus first test the impact of sub-county level barazas that combine
 information provision with a deliberation component on public service delivery
 and associated outcomes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are reasons to expect meaningful interactions between the information
 and the deliberation components of a baraza.
 For example, in a generic baraza, the information component is primarily
 designed to inform citizens about the activities of the service providers.
 To some extent, citizens are passive recipients of this information, and
 officials report what they consider relevant, or may even attempt to misreprese
nt the facts.
 If citizens can also engage with policy makers and civil servants, they
 may request information that is relevant to them.
 It may also result in information flows in the opposite direction as government
 officials learn about priorities and concerns of the citizens.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Information mechanism
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The relationship between citizens and government officials is reminiscent
 of the principal–agent problem.
 In essence, there are three players (elected politicians, civil servants
 and citizens) with only partly overlapping information sets and potentially
 competing interests.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
As the public servant must be responsive to the needs of both the client
 and the community at the same time, the problem can be characterized as
 a multiple or common agency problem, which adds a collective action component
 to the standard principle-agent problem

\end_layout

\end_inset

 Bringing stakeholders together in town-hall type meetings is assumed to
 reduce information asymmetries and may be an effective way to increase
 the quality of public service delivery by (1) allowing citizens to monitor
 and apply bottom-up pressure on under-performing civil servants and (2)
 increase top-down pressure on under-performing civil servants by revealing
 to politicians the discrepancy between what was promised and actual performance.
 A second central aim in this study is therefore to isolate the effect of
 the information provision component within the broader baraza intervention.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is some evidence that channeling of information to citizens about
 the quantity, modality, and quality of public services, as well as about
 the investments and policy decisions made by politicians, bureaucrats,
 and service providers, can increase the ability of the users to hold the
 leaders accountable and improve service provision.
 For example, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 campaigns about states’ school management obligations had a positive impact
 on school performance.

 disseminated information about job performance for randomly selected Ugandan

 While this increased job performance for the politicians on a range of

 find that targeted information reduced elite capture in Indonesia: mailing
 cards with program information to targeted beneficiaries increased the
 subsidy they received from a subsidized rice program.
 A recent review of 48 empirical studies on the impacts of information on
 governance and service delivery also suggests that the availability of
 information alone may not suffice.
 Information must be deemed relevant to its recipient, and individuals must
 have both power and incentives to act on the information

\begin_layout Subsection
Deliberation mechanism
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are various ways in which deliberation may increase the quality of
 public service delivery.
 First, it has a legitimizing effect on decisions arrived at in this fashion.
 Effective deliberation assumes equal voice of the arguments of both marginal
 and advantaged agents, and the role of evidence that support the positions
 articulated 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "mustalahti2014redd+"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Second, deliberation can more effectively distill social choice than simple
 voting and majoritarian rule, in part by building consensus both among
 citizens and between public servants and citizens 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "rosenberg2007deliberation"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Third, deliberation has been found to positively impact the vigor and breadth
 of subsequent citizen involvement in community affairs 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "bjorkman2017experimental"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Impacts of deliberative processes have also been the subject of empirical
 analysis.
 For example, in addition to increasing community participation mentioned
 above, experimental evidence also shows that deliberative processes may
 reduce the prevalence of clientelism

 show that town-hall style meetings like barazas during election campaigns
 increased voters' awareness on the issues parties campaigned on.
 The third key question is thus about the relative importance of the deliberativ
e component of a typical baraza.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Jurisdictional tier
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The baraza intervention can also be distinguished by the administrative
 level at which it is implemented.
 Barazas were originally implemented at the sub-county level, but from 2012
 onward, more and more barazas were implemented at the district level.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
An average district in Uganda consists of about 15 to 20 sub-counties.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 This administrative placement dimension immediately points to a potential
 trade-off between attempting to achieve breadth of coverage (through district-l
evel barazas), and depth of coverage (through sub-county-level barazas).
 While conducting a district-level baraza may be cheaper than conducting
 sub-county-level barazas in all sub-counties of that district, it is not
 clear a priori how these cost savings justify potential reduction in effectiven
ess of district-level barazas in any given sub-county of the concerned district.
 Therefore, a final objective of this study is to assess the impact of district
 level barazas and compare this to the effectiveness of barazas organized
 that the lower sub-county level.

Which is more effective, placement at a higher or lower level, will likely
 depend on the outcome and context.
 For instance, it has been argued that engaging small groups can be more
 effective because they can be coordinated more easily, but large groups
 may make more sense if the desired outcome would be enjoyed by a broader
 group

Experimental design
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To answer the above questions, we designed a social experiment covering
 districts, sub-counties, and households across the four regional blocks
 (Northern, Western, Central and Eastern) of Uganda.
 Each regional block has somewhat unique characteristics in terms of ethnicity,
 geographical and agro-ecological conditions, as well as cultural history.
 As noted in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Background-of-the"

\end_inset

, a small share of sub-counties, albeit located throughout all of Uganda’s
 112 districts across the four regions, had already received a sub-county
 level baraza intervention prior to the study.
 We thus selected our sample of districts from ‘eligible districts’, and
 our sample of sub-counties from ‘eligible sub-counties’.
 An ‘eligible district’ was defined as a district in which a district level
 baraza was not already implemented prior to the start of the study.
 An ‘eligible sub-county’ was defined as a sub-county to which two conditions
 applied: (i) a sub-county level baraza had not yet taken place, and (ii)
 the sub-county was in an ‘eligible district’.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The fact we restrict ourselves to eligible districts and sub-counties in
 this way has obvious consequences for the study population.
 For instance, the three districts that together constitute Karamoja, one
 of the poorest and most remote areas located in the northeast of Uganda,
 had already received district level barazas.
 As a result, this area was excluded from the analysis.
 While the impact evaluation had national coverage, this fact that we were
 evaluating and ongoing policy project needs to be kept in mind when interpretin
g results and extrapolating conclusions.

 In a second step, we proceeded with all eligible sub-counties and randomly
 allocated each sub-county to one of four conditions:

The experiment at the sub-county level was set up as a

 This was done such that power could be boosted by pooling treatment cells.
 However, as we find that often, interaction effects between the information
 and deliberation treatments are important, we ended up estimating fully
 saturated models as explained in the results section.
 As a result, the design at the sub-county level is equivalent to a parallel
 design with a control group, an information only group, a deliberation
 only group and an information+deliberation group.

 on citizens engaging with each other and with officials, with limited informati

\begin_inset Formula $\left(S_{D}^{0}\right)$

 We also took a random sample of sub-counties from the 
\begin_inset Formula $D^{ID}$
\end_inset

 districts that would receive the district level baraza 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(S_{0}^{ID}\right)$
\end_inset

 Within each sub-county, we randomly sampled five villages, and in each
 village, we randomly selected 10 households.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To determine the number of districts, sub-counties and households to include
 in the study, we ran an extensive series of power calculations that used
 data from the Uganda National Household Survey of 2009/10 and the Demographic
 and Health Survey of 2011 to estimate standard errors of the outcomes and
 inter-class correlations.
 In Online Appendix A.1, we show summary statistics for a range of household
 characteristics that were collected between June and September 2015 on
 about 12,500 households that were included in the study.
 We also test for balance between the different treatment groups at baseline
 for the original design.
 While we find that distance to the nearest road is slightly though statisticall
y significantly higher in areas that were planned to receive a sub-county
 level baraza, we do not think this points to structural imbalance.

Treatments

\begin_layout Standard
The treatments were based on the baraza intervention as designed and implemented
 by the government before the start of the study.
 A description of a generic sub-county level baraza was already given in
 Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Background-of-the"

\end_inset

.
 From such a generic baraza, we either removed the information component
 or the deliberation component to test the relative importance of these
 components.
 To standardize the treatments, we developed detailed scripts that RDCs
 and facilitators were expected to follow, and all were invited for a training.
 We will summarize the main differences between an information baraza and
 a deliberation baraza here.

\begin_layout Standard
For information barazas, templates to gather information were developed
 to be filled by officials and mounted at a central location in each parish
 of the sub-county (or the district in case of a district level baraza)
 two weeks before the baraza event was scheduled to take place.
 The template was designed to inform citizens about planned and actual public
 expenditures for the previous fiscal year, about achievements and challenges
 encountered during that year, and about planned expenditures and targets
 for the next fiscal year.
 This information needed to be provided for each of the four sectors (agricultur
e, infrastructure, health and education) by the sub-county chief.

While the preparation and distribution of these posters were the responsibility
 of the RDC, we had research assistants that closely monitored the implementatio

 We also assisted in printing of the template posters.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 On the day of the baraza event, the CAO was expected to give a brief presentati
on on the overall budget for the fiscal year, the main achievements and
 challenges in service delivery, and to introduce sector heads.
 After a brief intervention by the OPM, officials responsible for each sector
 then present the same as what was required for the templates.
 An information-focused baraza allowed for only 10 clarifying questions
 to be asked, to be collected and asked by the facilitator.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the deliberation barazas, posters were also mounted in each parish of
 the sub-county, but only to announce that a baraza was going to be held
 at a particular date and place.
 At the baraza itself, after a brief introduction by the OPM, citizens were
 instructed to break into four groups by sector, discuss problems they faced
 and draw up a list of priority issues that needed to be addressed.
 Facilitators in each group were required to anonymously collect these issues
 and concerns.
 Facilitators were expected to focus the discussion on what was done well,
 and on problems encountered during the past year.
 The discussions should also result in agreement on what should be done
 in the next fiscal year.
 After the break-out sessions, officials were asked to react to the specific
 comments and requests.

\begin_layout Standard
A sub-county level baraza in the crossed treatment group combined both elements.
 District level baraza were very similar to (information and deliberation)
 sub-county level barazas, except for the fact that district level barazas
 were organized at the district headquarters, all sub-county chiefs and
 LC3's of each sub-county were expected to attend in case questions arise
 related to their sub-county, and all citizens within the entire district
 were invited.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
All district level barazas were implemented as planned, so we mainly focus
 on sub-county level barazas here.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 At the start of 2018, and almost two and a half years after baseline data
 was collected, only about 25 percent of the planned sub-county level interventi
ons had happened.
 At that point, costs and benefits of waiting until the OPM finished all
 sub-county barazas or collecting baseline information after incomplete
 roll-out were assessed and various scenarios and strategies were evaluated.
 After an additional six months, with still only 56 out of the 155 sub-county
 barazas implemented, it appeared that the best scenario would be one whereby
 end-line data would be collected before all sub-counties were treated,
 given that the governments financial constraints made it unlikely that
 all barazas would be held any time soon.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Partial roll-out will have an impact on statistical power.
 More worryingly, end-line data collection after partial roll-out may introduce
 selection bias in the sub-sample of sub-counties that were assigned to
 the treatment.
 It may be that, from the randomly assigned treatment sub-counties, particular
 sub-counties were selected to be treated first and others postponed.
 For instance, for logistical reasons, the implementing partner may have
 started with sub-counties that were close to the capital, resulting in
 a treatment group that would not be directly comparable to the control
 group.
 Or the OPM may decide to prioritize sub-counties that perform worse on
 certain planning indicators, such as number of boreholes or student enrollment
 rates.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We acknowledge that the partial roll-out is a threat to internal validity
 that should not be ignored.
 At the same time, the fact that we started from a cluster Randomized Control
 Trial (RCT) still provides a substantial advantage over studies that are
 based on observational data.
 For instance, potential selection emanating from partial roll-out is restricted
 to the sub-sample of sub-counties that were assigned to be treated group
 only, significantly reducing the scope for bias.
 In addition, the list of sub-counties to be treated that we shared with
 the implementing partner was organized by treatment group (information,
 deliberation and combined treatment), and in each treatment group, sub-counties
 were listed alphabetically.
 Looking at the list considering the partial roll-out, we get the impression
 that the OPM started at the top of the list and worked their way down.
 As a result, relatively more sub-counties that were assigned the information
 treatment were treated, and sub-counties toward the top of the list for
 each treatment are also more likely to be treated.
 This pattern is confirmed when regressing the likelihood of being treated
 on the rank of the sub-county in the list.
 This is already a first indication that OPM officials did not deliberately
 select certain sub-counties.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section, we diagnose potential selection bias by assessing baseline
 balance between the planned-to-treat-but-not-treated sub-counties and control
 sub-counties.
 We then explain the endline data collection strategy to further reduce
 any remaining potential selection bias resulting from the partial roll-out:
 selection of control units by matching treatment and control units on range
 of sub-county characteristics that were likely to be known to the planner
 and may have affected how the intervention was rolled out.
 In Online Appendix A.2., we reflect on the fact that the partial roll-out
 also affects statistical power and simulate minimal detectable effect sizes
 at different power levels for the new reduced sample sizes associated with
 the partial roll-out, and conclude we maintain reasonable power.
 Online Appendix A.3.
 further shows attrition is small and unrelated to treatment assignment.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One way to test if selection bias was introduced by the partial roll-out
 is by comparing outcomes in control sub-counties to outcomes in sub-counties
 that were allocated to receive treatment but did not end up receiving treatment.
 If the roll-out was random, sub-counties that were allocated randomly to
 a particular treatment at the design stage but did not end up receiving
 treatment can be interchanged with sub-counties that were randomly selected
 at design stage to function as control sub-counties.
 Finding no significant differences in outcomes between these two groups
 would support the hypothesis that the partial roll-out did not introduce
 selection bias.
 If the incomplete roll-out introduced selection bias, comparing these two
 groups may also be informative to assess the direction and magnitude of
 the bias.
\begin_inset Foot

Alternative, one could restrict attention to the treatment group and compare
 sub-counties that ended up being treatment those that did not.

Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 presents a table with, for each of the three treatment arms affected by
 the partial roll-out, differences in average outcomes of planned but not
 treated sub-counties and planned control sub-counties (the first column
 also reports sample means).
 It is essentially the same table as the original balance table (Table A.1
 in the Online Appendix), but after dropping sub-counties that were treated.
 We find that the imbalance related to distance to nearest all weather road
 found in Online Appendix Table A.1 becomes even more pronounced.
 This may indicate that the OPM prioritized treatment of less remote areas.
 Similarly, for the information baraza, the imbalance for the number of
 children in school becomes stronger, suggesting information barazas were
 organized in areas where fewer children went to school to begin with.
 At the same time, it should be noted that significant differences are only
 found for comparison on which balance was also rejected in the original
 balance table.
 This suggests that the initial imbalance was likely caused by chance and
 balance may have been improved as a result of the (random) partial roll-out
 (see Table

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 summarizes the factorial design that underlies the sub-county level baraza
 impact evaluation.
 It shows that, based on the original power calculations, we planned to
 have between 51 and 53 sub-counties in each treatment cell (corresponding
 to about 2,550 to 2,650 households).
 At the start of the endline data collection, 29 sub-counties of the 51
 that were supposed to receive the information-only treatment were treated,
 18 sub-counties of the 51 that were supposed to receive the deliberation-only
 treatment were treated, and 20 sub-counties of the 53 that were supposed
 to receive the crossed (information + deliberation) treatment were treated.
 All eight districts that were supposed to be treated were treated, from
 which 40 sub-counties were sampled.
 Overall, this means that about 55 percent of the sub-counties that needed
 to receive any form of baraza were treated, corresponding to about 5,350
 households.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Statistical power is optimal when the number of treatment units is equal
 to the number of control units, and while adding more control sub-counties
 will increase power, the gains in power must be weighed against the cost
 of collecting additional data.
 As only part of the sub-county level intervention was implemented, it may
 thus not be cost effective to collect end-line data on all sub-counties
 that did not receive a treatment (either because they were allocated to
 the control or because they ended up not being treated).
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We decided to collect endline data on 40 control sub-counties, which is
 equal to the number of sub-counties that was treated with a district level
 baraza (the largest number of sub-counties among the different treatments).
\end_layout

\end_inset

 This raises the question: from the potential control sub-counties (either
 those that were allocated to the control or because they ended up not being
 treated), which sub-counties should be included in the endline data collection?
 One reasonable suggestion would be to pick them randomly.
 However, if the roll-out was not random, such a strategy may lead to a
 biased estimate of the causal impact of the intervention.
 For instance, if the OPM prioritized treatment of less remote areas, randomly
 selecting control sub-counties may result in a sample in which sub-counties
 in less remote locations are relatively under-represented and sub-counties
 that are in more remote areas relatively over-represented in the control
 group.
 A better strategy may be to match each treated sub-county to a control
 sub-county that is similar in a range of observable pre-treatment characteristi
cs that the planner had access to when the intervention was rolled out and
 are likely to have affected his or her decision

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We used a range of sub-county characteristics that were likely to be known
 to the planner and may have affected how the intervention was rolled out
 to match each treated sub-county to a control sub-county that was similar
 in terms of these characteristics.
 More in particular, we match on the following characteristics that were
 obtained at baseline from a survey of village chairs and CAO of each sub-county
: geographic location of the sub-county using GPS coordinates of the headquarter
s, road infrastructure within the sub-county (km tarmac road and km all-weather
 (gravel) road), share of households with electricity, share of households
 with an iron roof or tiles, number of health centers in the sub-county,
 female primary school dropout rate, number of Universal Primary Education
 (UPE) schools in the sub-county, percent of farmers that used improved
 seed, and political connections of the sub-county (defined by having a
 minister or member of parliament coming from the sub-county).
 These characteristics are used in a probit regression to predict the probabilit
y that a sub-county would be treated.
 The probabilities are then used to match each treated sub-county to a candidate
 control sub-county that is closest in terms of the predicted probability
 of being treated.
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

 shows baseline balance for the resulting sample.
 Two significant results out of 40 comparisons are again what can be expected
 from pure chance alone and so we conclude that also with this new sample
 we maintain balance between treatment and control on a range of baseline
 characteristics for the various comparisons.
 It is important to note that this matching was done before endline data
 was collected and the result of this ex-ante matching was also pre-registered
 to reduce specification search [placeholder for link to timestamped pre-registe

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the ex-ante matching strategy may reduce bias resulting from incomplete
 roll-out, there are also costs involved.
 First, if sample selection is introduced by the roll-out, matching may
 further reduce external validity of the study, as now also the control
 sub-counties are not a random sample of the study population anymore.
 Second, the reduction in potential bias for hypotheses related to the sub-count
y level barazas should be traded off against an increase in potential bias
 when testing differences between control and district level barazas.
 As the sub-county level analysis weighed higher in terms of research objectives
, we decided to prioritize the reduction of bias resulting from incomplete
 roll-out at this level.
 However, it should be kept in mind that both issues only become relevant
 if significant selection bias was introduced through the partial roll-out.

 From a policy perspective, in light of the shift from sub-county level

 It shows the impact of the four main hypotheses—the impact of the sub-county
 baraza, the relative effectiveness of the information component, the relative
 effectiveness of the deliberation component, and the impact of district
 level barazas—on four sectors we consider—agriculture, infrastructure,
 health, and education.
 As mentioned above, the graphs are based on indices that are composed of
 various outcomes in each sector as a first line of defense against the

This method first reconstructs a complete schedule of potential outcomes
 by adding and subtracting the average treatment effect for control and
 treated units respectively.
 These potential outcomes are then used to simulate all possible random
 allocations.
 For each allocation, average treatment effects are estimated and 2.5th and
 97.5th percentiles are then taken as the lower and upper limits of the 95
 percent confidence interval.
 As this provides a conservative estimate of the confidence interval, it
 may be that results in the graph appear insignificant, but do show up as
 significant when testing significance using Fisher's exact test in the
 tables in Online Appendix A.4.

\end_inset

 We also combine the four indices into one overall index that assesses the
 impact on public service delivery in general.
 We find no significant impact of the baraza program on overall public service
 delivery.
 There are some indications that sub-county level baraza did make a difference
 in the agricultural sector, though only at the 10 percent significance
 level.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The indices combine various outcomes, some of which the expected direction
 of the effect is unclear a-priori.
 For instance, an information baraza may increase the quality of services
 in a hospital or health center when judged by an objective measure such
 as waiting time.
 However, the information may also result in higher expectations from the
 part of the user.
 As such, perceptions of quality may have reduced as a result of an information
 baraza.
 It is therefore also interesting to look beyond the indices and consider
 outcomes individually.
 In Online Appendix A.4, we thus provide a detailed and more exploratory
 analysis of the individual outcomes behind these indices, and some other
 outcomes that were not pre-registered.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From that analysis, we learn that the positive effect of sub-county level
 barazas in the area of agricultural public service delivery seems to be
 driven by an increased likelihood that there are farmer groups or associations
 in the village (Online Appendix Table A.3).
 In Uganda, farmer groups and associations are important vehicles for receiving
 assistance from government, and we indeed see that the intervention also
 increased the likelihood that National Agriculture Advisory Services (NAADS)
 or Operation Wealth Creation (OWC) is present in the village.
 This, in turn, seems to have led to better access to agricultural extension
 and an increased likelihood that farmers have received improved seed varieties
 from government.
 We also see that the deliberation component is particularly important for
 the increases in farmer groups and associations, which is in line with
 the finding in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "bjorkman2017experimental"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 that deliberation positively impacts the likelihood that citizens organize
 themselves.
 The detailed analysis in Online Appendix A.4 also shows that sub-county
 barazas reduced waiting time at the water source and increased the likelihood
 that schools have electricity and that there is a water source in the school
 compound.

Mechanisms
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the primary aims of the community forums is to increase communication
 between politicians, civil servants and the citizens.
 We test if citizens interacted more with politicians and service providers
 as a result of the interventions.
 To do so, we asked how long it has been since the respondent spoke personally
 to various officials for reasons related to service provision in agriculture,
 health, education, water or roads.
 Based on the answer, we constructed an indicator variable that denotes
 if the household had a meeting recently or not.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The time frame changes depending on the official.
 For instance, for the Village Local Council chairperson (LC1), the indicator
 takes the value of one if the respondent spoke to him or her within the
 last month.
 For the head teacher, the reference period is six months.
 For the other officials (sub-county chief, health management unit member
 and water committee member), the indicator is true if contact was sought
 in the past year.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Results are in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The baraza intervention did not affect the likelihood that citizens meet
 with the LC1 or sub-county chiefs.
 We do see that the information component of the baraza increased the likelihood
 that citizens interface with the head teacher or with members of the school
 management unit.
 We also see that the information component of the sub-county level baraza
 increased the likelihood of meetings with water committee members, but
 the difference is not significant.
 Indices following 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "anderson2008multiple"

\end_inset

, show that the largest effect on meetings was due to the information component,
 but the effect is not significant.
 While the indices do not suggest an impact on contacts between citizens
 and officials, we do find that virtually all coefficients on sub-county
 level intervention are positive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The baraza program also attempts to increase a sense of community engagement.
 One way in which citizens can participate is through contributing to common
 goods such as public infrastructure, education, or health services.
 We differentiate between cash contributions and in-kind contributions and
 look at impact of the different interventions in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:contributions"

\end_inset

.
 Overall, most in-kind contributions were targeted towards drinking water
 facilities, and least in-kind contributions were going to dams or irrigation
 facilities, which is consistent with the difference in public goods nature
 of these facilities.
 We find that the information component of the sub-county baraza reduced
 in-kind contributions but increased cash contributions.
 For in-kind contributions, reductions in contributions were especially
 large for schools and for government or community buildings.
 The increase in cash contributions as a result of the information component
 of the baraza intervention was especially large for drinking water infrastructu
re.

\begin_layout Section
Heterogeneous treatment effects
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section, we look at heterogeneous treatment effects related to the
 timing of the interventions, ethnic homogeneity of the community and remoteness
 of the households.
 In Online Appendix A.5, we also look at heterogeneity related to levels
 of elite capture at baseline and differences in effects related to connections
 to people in powerful governance positions.

\begin_layout Subsection
Heterogeneity in the timing of the intervention
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The slow roll-out of the intervention over an extended period also introduced
 variation in the time that passed between treatment administration and
 end-line data collection.
 For instance, the first barazas were held around June 2016 (about one year
 after the baseline) and so more than three years will have passed between
 treatment administration and end-line data collection.
 For the most recent barazas, there will only be a few months between treatment
 administration and end-line data collection.
 One may argue that sub-counties or districts that were treated early on
 have been exposed to the program much longer and hence one may expect larger
 effects on a range of outcomes for these sub-counties or districts than
 areas that only recently received treatment.
 At the same time, for some outcomes, effects of the baraza intervention
 may dissipate (or even reverse) over time as enthusiasm fades, plans are
 abandoned and promises forgotten.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To capture this, we reran the analysis and added an interaction term between
 the treatment indicator and an indicator variable that takes the value
 of one if the baraza that the household was exposed to happened more than
 one and a half years before the endline data collection.

 We find a significant negative interaction effect from sub-county level
 barazas for the infrastructure index.
 For outcomes in the health sector, we find negative interaction effects
 for sub-county level barazas and for district level barazas.
 The negative interaction effect for the sub-county level baraza seems to
 be driven by a reduction of the likelihood that households turn to government
 health facilities for maternal health if the intervention took place more
 than 1.5 years ago.
 There are indications that these households are switching back to traditional
 healers, which may point to disappointment in the lack of progress made
 in public health facilities.
 For education, we do not find significant interaction effects based for
 the index.
 We do find a positive effect of sub-county level barazas on enrollment
 if the intervention took place more than 1.5 years ago.
 Overall, results suggest that the effectiveness of barazas seems to dissipate

 note that free-rider problems inherent to interventions aimed at increasing
 public action such as the baraza program may be exacerbated by ethnic fractiona

 In addition, they note that in such communities, government officials may
 also be less sensitive to non-monetary social rewards or sanctions.

 To construct this indicator, we follow 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

 and estimate sub-county level measures of ethno-linguistic fractionalization
 as one minus the sum of squared shares of the different ethno-linguistic
 groups in the sub-county.
 We then define sub-counties with high ethnic fractionalization as those
 with indices in excess of median ethno-linguistic fractionalization.

\begin_layout Standard
Contrary to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, we find that barazas appear to be most effective in less homogeneous sub-count
ies.
 This seems to be particularly the case for district level baraza and combined
 information and deliberation sub-county level barazas, and especially for
 outcomes in infrastructure and the health sector.
 For the infrastructure sector we find particularly strong interaction effects
 for distance to water source and distance to all-weather roads (see [placeholde

).
 Also in the health sector, distance to the nearest government health facility
 is reduced significantly as a result of both sub-county and district level
 barazas.
 In the education sector, we find that sub-county level barazas reduce distance
 to nearest government schools in highly fractionalized communities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It may be that barazas facilitate the organization of communities in the
 absence of the social cohesion necessary to engage them in infrastructural
 works.
 Consistent with this explanation, we find that distance to the nearest
 water source, distance to the nearest road, distance to the nearest government
 health facility and distance to the nearest public school are all significantly
 higher in control areas with high baseline levels of ethnic fractionalization
 than in control areas that are more homogeneous.

\begin_layout Subsection
Heterogeneity related to remoteness
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Heterogeneity related to the timing of the intervention and ethnic fractionaliza
tion have its source at the sub-county level.
 Heterogeneity may also be related to household level characteristics.
 During discussions with stakeholders, it was often argued that barazas
 may have different effects on households that live close to the sub-county
 headquarters versus those that live in more remote areas.
 At baseline, we collected data on the distance between the homestead of
 the household and the sub-county headquarter.
 We thus rerun the regressions but now add interaction effects for households
 that live four or more km away from the district headquarter.
 Results are summarized in Figure

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are some indications that district level barazas are more effective
 for households that live further away from the sub-county headquarters.
 This is particularly the case for outcomes in the agricultural sector.
 For households in remote areas, we find that a district level baraza leads
 to a significant increase in the likelihood that households are visited
 by extension officers at home, the likelihood that they visit an extension
 office, demonstration plot or model farmers, the likelihood of being assisted
 by NAADS, and the likelihood of being supported by a marketing cooperative
 (see [placeholder for link to online repository]

).
 Remote households also benefit from sub-county level barazas in terms of
 increased access to a protected water source, while district level barazas
 reduce waiting time at the source for this sub-group.
 We also find more positive treatment effects in the education sector if
 we focus on households that live further from the district headquarters.
 Overall, there are some indications that sub-county and district level
 barazas are particularly effective for households living in more remote
 locations.

\begin_layout Section
Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While we do find a range of interesting effects when using a more exploratory
 analysis, the main conclusion from our confirmatory analysis is in line
 with what most other studies find: there is no significant impact of the
 policy program on public service delivery as a whole 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "raffler2018weakness,olken2007monitoring,waddington2019citizen"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 In this section, we explore some of the potential reasons why barazas do
 not seem to translate into large overall or sector-wide improvements in
 public service delivery.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Community-based monitoring interventions such as the baraza program can
 only improve public service delivery if there is room for improvement:
 If politicians are already responsive to the needs of citizens and civil
 servants are delivering services of high quality, a baraza intervention
 is unlikely to have any significant additional effect on objectively verifiable
 outcomes such as waiting time in health centers or student-teacher ratios
 (however, a baraza could still change citizens' perceptions of public service
 delivery—see below).
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The fact that child mortality reduced significantly in response to the community
-based monitoring intervention in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

literal "false"

\end_inset

 but not in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "raffler2018weakness"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 is attributed to the fact that child mortality improved substantially over
 the last few decades, leaving little room for further improvement.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

 We think it is hard to argue that service delivery in Uganda cannot be
 improved.
 While progress has been made in some areas such as child mortality, other
 areas have seen less improvement.
 For instance, only about 10 percent of households report that they have
 access to agricultural extension (see Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Balance_planed_ctrl"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 Data obtained from our baseline survey shows that patients at government
 health centers must wait for medical examination for almost two hours on
 average and are examined by a nurse instead of a doctor in many cases.
 Access to water remains problematic, especially in the dry season when
 36 percent of households turn to potentially unsafe drinking water.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore, if there are no funds available for public service delivery,
 community-based monitoring will most likely not lead to the desired outcomes.
 Also here, we think that lack of funding is not the main issue.
 The liberalization and decentralization drive in the mid-eighties seduced
 donors across the globe to pour money into Ugandan public services.
 While there have been some studies reporting rampant elite capture 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
before "eg."
key "reinikka2004local"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, we asked government officials in all sub-counties of our sample during
 our baseline survey about the proportion of their public service budget
 that they actually received for the fiscal year 2013/2014, and they reported
 to have received on average 83 percent of their health and education budgets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The impact of the baraza program will also likely be muted if priorities
 of officials are not aligned with priorities of citizens.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Note that unaligned priorities do not fully explain why barazas have no
 effect: It may still be that services improve, but in sectors which citizens
 do not perceive as most problematic.
 However, assuming citizens know best where most progress can be made, unaligned
 priorities may reduce effectiveness of the barazas.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 For priorities to be aligned, it is important that what is discussed during
 the barazas is also what citizens think is most important.
 This may not automatically be the case, as the most vocal individuals may
 dominate the discussion due to group dynamics and attempt to skew decisions
 during the meeting in their favor.
 Reports also indicate that barazas sometimes turn into political rallies.
 To explore the alignment between what citizens deem important and what
 transpires at the baraza event, we would need detailed information about
 what was discussed and concluded during the meetings in addition to the
 baseline information of what citizens perceive as important.
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Alignment"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 uses information obtained from reports redacted by the OPM for 10 random
 sub-county level baraza events.
 Using these reports, we determine for each baraza which sector was most
 discussed (column 4).
 This is then compared to baseline data on priorities obtained from citizens
 living in that sub-county (column 3).
 We find that what is prioritized by citizens is also discussed in the baraza
 in four out of 10 sub-counties.
 This suggests some degree of alignment between priorities of citizens and
 what is discussed during the baraza event.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even if what transpires in a baraza reflects the priorities of the citizens,
 there will be no impact if officials subsequently do not act on this.
 To explore this link in the causal impact chain, we added to Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Alignment"
plural "false"

noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 a column where for each of the 10 sub-counties we report in what sector
 most positive changes were recorded during endline.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\end_inset

 We find that in only two out of 10 sub-counties, the sector that was discussed
 most during the baraza event was also the sector where most positive change
 was recorded.

\begin_layout Standard
Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 thus suggests that while priorities of citizens do seem to get discussed
 during barazas, it is less common that what was decided also gets implemented.
 Using focus group discussions, we gauged reasons why this link breaks down.
 Firstly, if a baraza is seen as a one off event, officials are less likely
 to act on it.
 We have seen in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Heterogeneity-in-the"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 that optimism among citizens and other stakeholders can quickly turn into
 disappointment if none of the issues raised is addressed.
 Secondly, poor relationships between politicians and technical personnel
 can hinder the effectiveness of barazas.
 For example, a poor relation or communication between a CAO and a LC5 Chairpers
on can impede public service delivery.
 Thirdly, if barazas mainly expose issues beyond the accountability of the
 officials and service providers present, they will not be conducive for
 service provision.
 Some issues fall under the responsibility of higher levels of government
 or other institutions that are beyond the operational jurisdiction of people
 present at the barazas.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, it may also be that barazas do not lead to changes in public service
 delivery, but that there still is a change in use and appreciation by the
 citizens.
 During qualitative research, we found that government officials, and particular
ly civil servants, often complained that barazas should also contain an
 element of “civic education”.
 Providing information about the nature of public services and the limitations
 of what public servants can do may help manage the expectations of citizens,
 in turn increasing their use.
 One example given was that citizens complain that they still become sick
 after drinking water from boreholes that were installed by government.
 The officials responsible for water and infrastructure objected that citizens
 need to treat water (for example by boiling or using chlorine), even if
 it comes from a borehole.
 If this information would be available to citizens, perhaps their expectations
 would be more aligned with what public servants deliver.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To explore this civic education function of barazas, we test if, even though
 there is no impact on objectively verifiable outcomes, the baraza intervention
 affected perceptions by citizens.
 In particular, we asked citizens to rate, on a Likert scale, how satisfied
 they were with public service delivery in the four sectors.
 We find some indications that a combined information and deliberation baraza
 improved citizens satisfaction related to access to water.
 Satisfaction about schooling also improved but is just not significant.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\end_inset

 function of baraza may also explain why 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "raffler2018weakness"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 find that their health focused community monitoring intervention significantly
 increased satisfaction without affecting outcomes.
 As such, town-hall style meetings may still be beneficial even if they
 do not lead to real changes in public service delivery.

\begin_layout Section
Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To improve governance and public service delivery in Uganda, the OPM organizes
 town-hall style meetings—popularly known as barazas—where citizens receive
 information from government officials and get the opportunity to directly
 engage with them.
 In 2015, we designed a cluster RCT aimed at evaluating the effectiveness
 of this policy intervention.
 The study set out to answer four research questions: (1) What is the impact
 of the baraza as originally designed and implemented by the OPM? (2) What
 is the relative effectiveness of the information component of a baraza?
 (3) What is the relative effectiveness of the deliberative component of
 a baraza? And: (4) Should a baraza be organized at the district level or
 at the sub-county level? Baseline data from more than 12,500 households
 spread over almost 250 sub-counties in about 40 districts throughout Uganda
 was collected and the OPM started implementing barazas following our experiment
al design and protocols.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The OPM faced various challenges that affected the timely roll-out of the
 barazas, including budgetary constraints and disruptions related to the
 general elections of 2016.
 This resulted in the decision to collect end-line information after partial
 roll-out, more than four years after baseline data was collected.
 Various strategies were followed to test, and reduce the consequences of,
 potential selection bias and sample size reduction introduced by this partial
 roll out.
 Early 2020, endline data was collected on 6,700 households.
 We find that the partial roll-out did not introduce significant bias and,
 judged by a series of Minimal Detectable Effect simulations, we conclude
 that we maintain reasonable statistical power.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Judged by an index of overall public service delivery, we find no significant
 impact of the program.
 There are some indications that sub-county level barazas had a positive
 impact on service delivery in the agricultural sector.
 Looking at outcomes in more detail, we found that households reported increased
 access to agricultural extension in areas that were exposed to a sub-county
 level baraza.
 Furthermore, driven by the deliberation component, sub-county level barazas
 also appeared to increase the share of households that reported that they
 received improved seed from the government extension system.
 This was also reflected in the higher share of households that reported
 that NAADS/OWC was active in their village in this subgroup.
 We also found that sub-county level barazas increased the likelihood that
 farmer cooperatives or groups were formed in the villages in Uganda.
 The time that one must wait at the water source reduced by about 25 percent
 after a sub-county level baraza took place.
 Finally, we found that sub-county level baraza seemed to improve school
 infrastructure.
 Impact on the health sector was limited.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also explored two mechanisms that are at the core of community-based
 monitoring: interfacing with politicians and civil servants, and contributions
 to public goods (both cash and in-kind).
 There was some evidence that the information component of the baraza increased
 meetings with officials or service providers: even though only a significant
 effect was found on meetings with the head teacher or members of the school
 management committee, coefficients on all other indicators were positive
 and often substantial.
 We further found that the information component of the sub-county baraza
 reduced in-kind contributions, but increased cash contributions.
 This may indicate that barazas increased trust in officials and strengthened
 the social contract.

When looking at heterogeneity in treatment effects, we often saw that initially
 positive effects turned negative after some time.
 This may indicate that investments were made immediately after the baraza
 events, but resources dried up after some time.
 It also suggests that over time, households became increasingly frustrated
 with the lack of progress made against the actions that were promised during
 barazas.
 At the same time, some important outcomes such as a reduction in morbidity
 and an increase in school enrollment only materialized after some time.
 We also found that barazas appear to be most effective in less homogeneous
 sub-counties: In sub-counties characterized by substantial ethnic heterogeneity
, health, school and water infrastructure seemed to be lacking.
 This suggests that baraza may be an effective way to mobilize communities
 that were less likely to invest in public goods due to weak social ties.
 Finally, we looked at heterogeneity related to remoteness and found that
 especially district level barazas benefited remote households more than
 households that live close to the sub-county headquarters.

Our somewhat more encouraging results than those found in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "raffler2018weakness"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 may be explained by the fact that our intervention is organized by the
 government: 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "raffler2018weakness"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 find indications that the presence of sub-county officials during the programmi
ng boosted the impact of the intervention on treatment quality in health
 centers.
 Our analysis thus confirms that top-down monitoring may be more important
 in changing behavior of civil servants, but that community involvement
 may be an effective way to pressure officials into increased top-down monitorin
g.
 Baraza may also be effective vehicles for civic education.
 We further find that what is discussed during baraza events reflects what
 citizens prioritize, but that officials often fail to act on this.
 Focus group discussions suggest that officials would be more forthcoming
 if baraza meetings would be organized more frequently.
