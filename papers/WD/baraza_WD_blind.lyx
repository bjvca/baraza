\begin_layout Title
The impact of community-based monitoring on public service delivery: A randomize
d control trial in Uganda
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
In many developing countries, poor delivery of public services remains an
 important problem.
 Through community-based monitoring, beneficiaries of public services can
 apply bottom-up pressure to under-performing service providers and their
 political leadership.
 In this spirit, the Government of Uganda organizes community fora—popularly
 known as barazas—where citizens receive information from government officials
 and get the opportunity to challenge them.
 We designed a cluster randomized control trial to assess the impact of
 this policy intervention on public service delivery in agriculture, health,
 education, and infrastructure.
 We further test the relative importance of the two main components of the
 intervention—information provision and citizen engagement.
 We also compare the effectiveness of barazas organized at the district
 level to the effectiveness of barazas organized at the sub-county level.
 Following a pre-specified confirmatory analysis, we do not find that the
 intervention has significant effects on general public service delivery,
 though there are signs of improvement in agricultural sector public services.
 We discuss some of the potential reasons for this finding, including assumption
s underlying the impact pathways, the political context in which the program
 was implemented, and challenges related to the evaluation of large policy
 programs.

In many developing countries, the delivery of public services remains problemati
c.
 Public infrastructure, such as roads or boreholes for drinking water, is
 poor.
 The quality of service provided in hospitals and schools is low.
 Absenteeism and corruption are endemic.
 This is also the case in Uganda, where the public service sector suffers
 from high levels of elite capture, ineffective monitoring, and weak accountabil
ity 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "reinikka2004local"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 In response to this, the Office of the Prime Minister (OPM) implemented
 the baraza program, an initiative of the president of Uganda, to improve
 public service delivery by enhancing public involvement in holding the
 government accountable for service delivery in relation to resources spent
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "New1"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 The program brings politicians, civil servants, and citizens together in
 town hall-type meetings (barazas) to share information and engage with
 each other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since 2009, barazas have been organized in sub-counties throughout Uganda.
 However, no rigorous impact evaluation was undertaken until now.
 A first objective of this paper is thus to assess if the program had an
 impact on public service delivery and associated outcomes.
 Furthermore, in 2012, the OPM decided to organize subsequent barazas at
 a higher administrative level (district) instead of at the sub-county level,
 mainly to reduce cost and speed up roll-out.
 A second major objective of this study is to inform policy makers on the
 consequences of this change in terms of effectiveness of the program.
 A third objective of the study is to assess the relative importance of
 the two main components of a generic baraza event and differentiate between,
 on the one hand, the impact of arming citizens with information related
 to budgeting and spending, and, on the other hand, the impact of allowing
 citizens to engage with public servants and politicians in moderated question-a
nd-answer sessions.
 We answer these research questions using a cluster randomized control trial
 (RCT).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are several studies that look at the impact of community-based monitoring
 on public service delivery, many of them implemented in Uganda.
 A landmark study is 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "bjorkman2009power"
literal "true"

\end_inset

, who analyze the impact of a community-driven local accountability project
 in primary health care provision in Uganda.
 They find that community-based monitoring resulted in significant improvements
 in health care delivery, utilization, and health outcomes (most notably
 child mortality and weight-for-age z-scores) after one year, and confirm
 in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "bjorkman2017experimental"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 that these effects also hold in the longer run.
 More recently, however, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "raffler2018weakness"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 come to different conclusions when testing an intervention closely modeled
 on the one of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "bjorkman2009power"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 in a similar setting.
 The study, involving a three-wave panel of more than 14,000 households,
 shows that the intervention was able to change the behavior of public service
 providers.
 However, it did not find that it directly increased community monitoring,
 nor generated improvements in health outcomes, at least in the short run.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our study contributes to this literature in various ways.
 First, it is one of the few studies that consider the role of the jurisdictiona
l tier on the effectiveness of community-based monitoring.
 The level at which the town-hall meetings are organized may affect their
 effectiveness in opposing ways: interventions at a more local level may
 result in more relevant issues being scrutinized.
 However, qualitative explorations suggest that, often, issues raised in
 lower level barazas are beyond the operational jurisdiction of the officials
 that are present 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "van2018impact"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 This may be less of a problem if barazas are organized at district-level.
 Most other studies consider interventions that were placed at local jurisdictio
nal levels.
 For instance, the intervention in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "raffler2018weakness"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 was implemented in health centers and their associated catchment areas,
 defined as the three villages closest to the health center.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Second, our study evaluates the impact of a large-scale, high-profile policy
 intervention that receives broad support within the government, among opinion
 leaders and among citizens in Uganda.
 Such interventions may trigger an entirely different set of dynamics than
 interventions that are organized by local or international Non-governmental
 organizations (NGOs), as in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "bjorkman2009power"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "raffler2018weakness"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 For instance, many of the actors involved may find that NGOs are not mandated
 when it comes to public services such as health and education.
 This is also consistent with suggestive evidence in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "raffler2018weakness"
literal "true"

\end_inset

, who find that the presence of sub-county officials during their community-base
d monitoring intervention boosted its impact.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Third, barazas take a comprehensive, multi-sector approach, enabling cross-secto
ral planning and potentially allowing for re-allocation of resources across
 sectors to solve problems that were identified during these meetings.
 Some of the problems most mentioned by users, such as hygiene in health
 centers or accessibility, involve cooperation between heads of different
 sectors (for example, health and infrastructure to get access to water
 in health centers).
 Bringing civil servants from different sectors together and confronting
 them with the priorities of citizens may increase information sharing and
 cooperation between them.
 Most other studies focus on a single sector; health in particular seems
 to be a popular sector for community monitoring interventions 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This paper also serves as an illustration of the challenges of evaluating
 real-world policy interventions and how to deal with them.
 While we feel that field experiments with policy interventions provide
 greater external validity than the carefully designed and closely monitored
 ones implemented by NGOs that are commonly published, real-world policy
 experimentation is challenging: researchers need to overcome political
 resistance to randomization and commit to an hands-off approach, even if
 things do not go as planned 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "de2019rise"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Our study is no exception, as the OPM faced various challenges that affected
 the roll-out of the intervention, including budgetary constraints and disruptio
ns related to the general elections of 2016.
 Four years after the baseline survey, with about 50 percent of the planned
 interventions completed, we needed to trade-off waiting for the remaining
 barazas to be implemented and conducting the end-line after partial roll-out.
 We decided to proceed with end-line data collection and employ various
 strategies to diagnose and mitigate problems that may have been introduced
 by the partial roll-out.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find that barazas do not impact public service delivery as measured by
 a pre-registered summary index of various outcomes in four key sectors.
 If we zoom into these sectors, there are signs that sub-county-level barazas
 are effective in the agricultural sector.
 This is in line with recent overview articles, meta-analyses, and replications
 of influential studies on the benefits of community-based monitoring such
 as the one by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "raffler2018weakness"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The emerging consensus is that community-based monitoring can be effective,
 but only if certain conditions are met, and that effects may differ for
 different groups and outcomes.
 For instance, the perceptions of citizens related to the intentions and
 legitimacy of the organizing entity may affect impact 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "doi:10.1080/00220388.2015.1134778"

\end_inset

.
 Furthermore, individuals must have both the power and incentives to act
 on information they receive during interactions with officials 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "KOSEC2020104376"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Effects on some outcomes (such as citizen engagement) may be stronger than
 effects on other outcomes (such as child mortality), depending on where
 in the causal chain impact is measured and on the scope for further improvement
 in the outcome 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "raffler2018weakness"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Building on this literature, we look at potential reasons why barazas are
 not more effective in our specific case.
 We start by exploring the theory of change behind the baraza program, such
 as the alignment of priorities between citizens and officials, and the
 subsequent translation of priorities into strategies and actions.
 We then discuss how the political context in which community-based monitoring
 is embedded can affect effectiveness and point to various red flags in
 the Ugandan case.
 Finally, we point out methodological challenges inherent to the evaluation
 of interventions where interactions between citizens and government officials
 lead to treatment heterogeneity (as opposed to the theoretical ideal where
 experimental units are assumed to be passive recipients of a uniform and
 homogeneous treatment) and argue that this heterogeneity is likely to dilute
 average treatment effects.

 In Zanzibar, they are essential features of the social discourse and have

 set of rules and a particular code of behavior

 In Burundi, barazas have traditionally been used to settle differences

 In Kenya, barazas refer to assemblies where politicians and bureaucrats

 These meetings are usually held outdoors, individually licensed by the
 state, and range in size from smaller gatherings to large assemblies with
 several thousand participants who are addressed by the president

 Until today, all Kenyan chiefs are required by law to convene at least
 two barazas per month.

\begin_layout Standard
The above shows that barazas have a long history in the region.
 The attempt of the Government of Uganda to leverage such an important instituti
on to increase its own effectiveness is interesting and may lead to quite
 different outcomes than other community monitoring interventions.
 At the same time, community fora organized by the government may crowd
 out or even replace alternative community fora that are potentially more
 inclusive and more critical of those in power.

\begin_layout Standard
In the mid-1980s, after attaining relative stability, the Government of
 Uganda, supported by development partners, initiated far reaching liberalizatio
n efforts and introduced a decentralized system of governance, in which
 district and sub-county administrations received considerable responsibilities
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "francis2003balancing"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 This process was assumed to bring representative governance closer to the
 people and to align public services to citizen needs.
 However, two decades after these ambitious reforms, public services in
 Uganda continued to be characterized by misaligned priorities, substandard
 services, elite capture, ineffective monitoring, and weak accountability
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "reinikka2004local"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In response to this, the Government of Uganda, under the stewardship of
 the OPM, initiated community-based monitoring and accountability fora (or
 barazas) with the general objective of “enhancing public involvement in
 holding the government accountable for service delivery in relation to
 the resources spent” 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "New1"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 Barazas were conceived as platforms that enhance information sharing between
 policy makers (the client), public service providers (the implementer),
 and beneficiaries of public goods and services (the users).
 In addition, barazas were designed to provide users with an opportunity
 to ask questions to the client and the implementer and to deliberate among
 themselves.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Barazas were piloted in the financial year 2009/2010.
 Since then, efforts have been underway to roll out barazas in all sub-counties
 in the country.
 By the last quarter of the 2011/2012 financial year, 267 of the country's
 total 1,340 sub-counties, spread over 112 districts, had held a baraza
 meeting.
 At the beginning of 2012/2013, however, changes in implementation were
 suggested: subsequent barazas would target districts instead of sub-counties
 to accelerate roll-out, increase participation at a higher jurisdictional
 level, and reduce costs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A typical baraza meeting is initiated from the center, with the OPM mobilizing
 district and sub-county officials.
 These include the Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) as the head of public
 service providers at the district level, the Resident District Commissioner
 (RDC) as a direct representative of the president, the District Local Council
 chairperson (LC5) as the representative of political leadership at the
 district level, and the sector heads responsible for public services in
 each sector (agriculture, education, infrastructure, and health).
 For sub-county-level barazas, the equivalent of the CAO at the sub-county
 level (the sub-county chief) and the Sub-county Local Council chairperson
 (LC3) also have important roles.
 The OPM, in consultation with the district leaders (RDC, CAO, and LC5)
 and other stakeholders, agrees on a date and a neutral location.
 Again, in consultation with the district leaders, viable moderators are
 identified to guide the baraza forum.
 Village mobilizers and community resource persons publicize the event.
 These community mobilization efforts are further reinforced by adverts
 in the local media in the form of radio announcements, printed banners,
 posters and fliers, and mobile public address systems, a few days before
 the baraza event.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A baraza meeting is chaired by the RDC's office.
 In front of the audience, including local citizens, invited opinion leaders,
 elders, and journalists, the moderators seek feedback from the head of
 each major sector (agriculture, education, health, and infrastructure).
 Sector heads present which services were planned to be delivered in the
 sub-county (or district for district-level barazas), which services were
 actually delivered, which issues and challenges have emerged, and what
 is the way forward.
 The moderators then seek feedback from citizens on whether what has been
 presented is what they understand was planned and actually implemented.
 Sector heads are then given another opportunity to clarify, or react to,
 any issues raised by the citizens.
 At the end of the process, a report to the OPM is prepared, indicating
 issues that arose in the baraza meeting.
 This report points out policy and program implementation weaknesses and
 challenges, which is expected to further feed into the general government
 performance management system.
 Usually, a minister of state is also present at the baraza.
 Baraza events often become emotional and attract considerable media attention,
 also from national newspapers.

Impact of (sub-county-level) barazas
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The baraza intervention is a community-based monitoring intervention that
 combines the provision of information with the opportunity for citizens
 to engage with each other and with decision makers at a local level.
 Community-based monitoring has become a popular tool to improve public
 service delivery.
 However, not all interventions seem to achieve success 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "olken2007monitoring,waddington2019citizen"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 A key question is therefore related to the effectiveness of a typical baraza
 intervention as originally conceived and organized by the OPM.
 We thus first test the impact of sub-county-level barazas that combine
 information provision with a deliberation component on public service delivery
 and associated outcomes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is reasonable to expect meaningful interactions between the information
 and deliberation components of a baraza.
 For example, in a generic baraza, the information component is primarily
 designed to inform citizens about the activities of the service providers.
 To some extent, citizens are passive recipients of this information, and
 officials report what they consider relevant, or may even attempt to misreprese
nt the facts.
 If citizens can also engage with policy makers and civil servants, they
 may request information that is relevant to them.
 It may also result in information flows in the opposite direction as government
 officials learn about the priorities and concerns of citizens.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Information mechanism
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The relationship between citizens and government officials is reminiscent
 of the principal-agent problem.
 In essence, there are three players (elected politicians, civil servants,
 and citizens) with only partly overlapping information sets and potentially
 competing interests.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
As the public servant must be responsive to the needs of both the client
 and the community at the same time, the problem can be characterized as
 a multiple or common agency problem, which adds a collective action component
 to the standard principal-agent problem

 Bringing these stakeholders together in town hall-type meetings is assumed
 to reduce information asymmetries and may be an effective way to improve
 the quality of public services by (1) allowing citizens to monitor and
 apply bottom-up pressure on under-performing civil servants and by (2)
 revealing the discrepancy between what was promised and what was actually
 delivered to politicians, increasing top-down pressure on under-performing
 civil servants.
 A second aim of this study is therefore to isolate the effect of the informatio
n provision component within the broader baraza intervention.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is some evidence that channeling information about the quantity, modality,
 and quality of public services, as well as about the investments and policy
 decisions by politicians, bureaucrats, and service providers to citizens,
 can increase their ability to hold leaders accountable and thus improve
 service provision.
 For example,

 cards with program information to targeted beneficiaries increased the
 subsidy they received from a subsidized rice program.
 A recent review of 48 empirical studies on the impact of information on
 governance and service delivery suggests that the availability of information
 alone may not be sufficient.
 Information must be deemed relevant to its recipient, and individuals must
 have both power and incentives to act on the information

Deliberation may improve the quality of public services in different ways.

 agents, and the role of evidence that supports the positions articulated
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Second, deliberation can distill social choice more effectively than simple

 citizens and between public servants and citizens 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

Baraza interventions can also be distinguished by the administrative level

 Barazas were originally implemented at the sub-county level, but from 2012
 onwards, many were implemented at the district level.

 This points to a potential trade-off between achieving breadth of coverage
 (through district-level barazas), and depth of coverage (through sub-county-lev
el barazas).
 While conducting one district-level baraza is likely to be cheaper than
 conducting sub-county-level barazas in all sub-counties in that district,
 it is not clear a priori how these cost savings justify potential reductions
 in effectiveness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whether placement at a higher or lower level is more effective is likely
 to depend on the outcome and the context.
 For instance, it has been argued that engaging small groups can be more
 effective because they can be coordinated more easily, but large groups
 may be preferable if the desired outcome would be enjoyed by a broader
 group

 Furthermore, action may be more likely if an issue is brought by a large
 group instead of a small group of people that complains about a highly
 localized issue

 It may also be that issues highlighted at the local level fall under the
 responsibility of higher-level authorities and vice versa.
 Therefore, a final objective of this study is to assess the impact of district-
level barazas and compare it to the effectiveness of barazas organized at
 the lower sub-county level.

To answer the above research questions, we designed a field experiment that
 covers districts, sub-counties, and households across the four regional
 blocks of Uganda (Northern, Western, Central, and Eastern).
 Each regional block has unique characteristics in terms of ethnicity, geographi
cal and agro-ecological conditions, as well as cultural history.
 As noted in Section

Restricting ourselves to eligible districts and sub-counties has obvious
 consequences for the study population.
 For instance, the three districts that constitute Karamoja, one of the
 poorest and most remote areas located in the northeast of Uganda, had already
 received district-level barazas.
 As a result, this area was excluded from the analysis.
 While the impact evaluation had national coverage, the fact that we evaluate
 an ongoing policy project needs to be kept in mind when interpreting results

 However, as we find that the interaction effects between the information
 and deliberation treatments are often important, we estimate fully saturated
 models as explained in the results section.
 As a result, the design at the sub-county level is equivalent to a parallel
 design with a control group, an information only group, a deliberation
 only group and an information+deliberation group.

 We also took a random sample of sub-counties from the

 Within each sub-county, we randomly sampled five villages, and in each
 village, we randomly selected 10 households.

\begin_layout Standard
To determine the number of districts, sub-counties, and households to include
 in the study, we ran an extensive series of power calculations using data
 from the Uganda National Household Survey of 2009/2010 and the Demographic
 and Health Survey of 2011 to estimate standard errors of and correlations
 between the outcome variables.
 In Online Appendix A.1, we show summary statistics for a range of characteristic
s of about 12,500 households that were included in the study, collected
 between June and September 2015.
 We also test for baseline balance between the different treatment groups
 in the original design.
 While we find significant differences for three out of 40 comparisons,
 we do not think that this indicates structural imbalance.

The treatments are based on barazas as designed and implemented by the governmen

 A generic sub-county-level baraza was already described in Section

 From such a generic baraza, we either removed the information component
 or the deliberation component to test their relative importance.
 To standardize the treatments, we developed detailed scripts that RDCs
 and facilitators were expected to follow, and invited them for training.
 We will summarize the main differences between an information baraza and
 a deliberation baraza in this section.

\begin_layout Standard
For information barazas, templates to gather information were filled by
 officials and posted in central locations in each parish of the sub-county
 (or district for district-level barazas) two weeks before the baraza event
 took place.
 The template was designed to inform citizens about planned and actual public
 expenditures in the previous fiscal year, about achievements and challenges
 during that year, and about planned expenditures and targets for the next
 fiscal year.
 This information was provided by the sub-county chief for each of the four
 sectors (agriculture, infrastructure, health, and education).

While the preparation and distribution of these posters were the responsibility
 of the RDC, there were research assistants that closely monitored the implement

\end_inset

 On the day of the baraza event, the CAO introduced the sector heads and
 gave a brief presentation on the overall budget for the fiscal year, and
 the main achievements and challenges in service delivery.
 After a brief intervention by the OPM, officials responsible for each sector
 presented the information on the templates.
 An information-focused baraza allowed for only 10 clarifying questions,
 to be collected and asked by the facilitator.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For deliberation barazas, posters were also mounted in each parish of the
 sub-county (or district for district-level barazas), but only announced
 that a baraza was going to be held at a particular date and place.
 At the baraza, after a brief introduction by the OPM, citizens were instructed
 to break into four groups by sector, discuss problems they faced and draw
 up a list of priority issues that needed to be addressed.
 Facilitators in each group were expected to focus the discussion on what
 was done well, on the problems citizens encountered during the past year,
 and on what needs to be done in the next fiscal year.
 They were also required to anonymously collect the resulting information.
 After the break-out sessions, officials reacted to the specific comments
 and requests.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A sub-county-level baraza in the crossed treatment group combined both elements.
 District-level barazas were similar to (information and deliberation) sub-count
y-level barazas, except for the fact that they were organized at the district
 headquarters, that the chiefs and LC3's of each sub-county were expected
 to attend in case questions related to their sub-county arose, and that
 all citizens in the district were invited.

Our implementing partner OPM faced substantial challenges in the roll-out
 of sub-county-level barazas.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
All district-level barazas were implemented as planned, therefore this section
 focuses on sub-county-level barazas.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 At the start of 2018, and almost two and a half years after baseline data
 was collected, only about 25 percent of the planned sub-county-level interventi
ons had happened.
 At that point, costs and benefits of waiting until the OPM finished all
 barazas or collecting baseline information despite incomplete roll-out
 were assessed.
 After an additional six months, with still only 56 of 155 sub-county barazas
 done, we decided to collect end-line data before all sub-counties were
 treated, given that the government's financial constraints made it unlikely
 that all barazas would be held anytime soon.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
End-line data collection after partial roll-out will affect statistical
 power.
 More worryingly, it may introduce selection bias in the sub-sample of sub-count
ies that were assigned to the treatment.
 It may be that, from the sub-counties randomly assigned to treatment, particula
r sub-counties were treated first, and others postponed.
 For instance, the implementing partner may have started with sub-counties
 near the capital for logistical reasons, resulting in a treatment group
 that is not directly comparable to the control group.
 Or the OPM may have decided to prioritize sub-counties that perform the
 worst on certain indicators, such as the number of boreholes or student
 enrollment rates.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We acknowledge the partial roll-out as a threat to internal validity that
 should not be ignored.
 At the same time, the fact that we started from a cluster RCT still provides
 substantial advantages over studies that are based on observational data.
 For instance, potential selection emanating from partial roll-out is restricted
 to the sub-sample of sub-counties that was assigned to be treated, substantiall
y reducing the scope for bias.
 In addition, the list of sub-counties to be treated that we shared with
 the implementing partner was organized by treatment group (information,
 deliberation, and combined treatment), and in each treatment group, sub-countie
s were listed alphabetically.
 Looking at this list, we get the impression that the OPM started at the
 top and worked its way down: relatively more sub-counties that were assigned
 to the information baraza were treated, and relatively more sub-counties
 at the top of each treatment group were treated.
 This pattern is confirmed when we regress the likelihood of a sub-county
 being treated on its rank in the list.
 This is a first indication that OPM officials did not deliberately select
 certain sub-counties.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section, we diagnose potential selection bias by assessing baseline
 balance between assigned-to-be-treated-but-not-treated sub-counties and
 control sub-counties.
 We then explain the end-line data collection strategy that further reduces
 potential selection bias: selecting control units by matching them to treatment
 units on a range of sub-county characteristics that may have affected how
 the intervention was rolled out.
 In Online Appendix A.2, we investigate the impact of the partial roll-out
 on statistical power.
 To do so, we use simulation methods to estimate minimum detectable effect
 sizes at different power levels for the reduced sample size associated
 with the partial roll-out and conclude that we maintain reasonable power.
 Online Appendix A.3 further shows that attrition is low and independent
 of the treatment assignment.

\begin_layout Standard
One way to test if selection bias was introduced by the partial roll-out
 is to compare outcomes in sub-counties that were randomly allocated to
 function as controls to outcomes in sub-counties that were randomly allocated
 to receive treatment but did not end up receiving treatment.
 If the roll-out was random, these sub-counties could be interchanged.
 Finding no significant differences between these two groups would therefore
 support the hypothesis that the partial roll-out has not introduced selection
 bias.
 If the incomplete roll-out has introduced selection bias, comparing these
 groups will also be informative to assess the direction and magnitude of
 the bias.

Alternatively, one could restrict attention to sub-counties that were randomly
 allocated to receive treatment and compare the ones that ended up being

 presents differences between assigned-to-be-treated-but-not-treated sub-countie
s and control sub-counties for each of the three treatment arms affected
 by the partial roll-out.
 It is equivalent to the original balance table (Table A.1 in the Online
 Appendix), but after dropping sub-counties that were actually treated.
 We find that the imbalance related to the distance to the nearest all-weather
 road as shown in Online Appendix Table A.1 becomes more pronounced.
 This may indicate that the OPM prioritized the treatment of areas that
 are less remote.
 Similarly, the imbalance for the number of children in public schools is
 further accentuated, suggesting that information barazas were first organized
 in areas with fewer children in public schools prior to the study.
 At the same time, it should be noted that we only find significant differences
 for comparisons that rejected balance also in the original balance table.

Figure

 summarizes the factorial design that underlies the sub-county-level baraza
 impact evaluation.
 It shows that, based on the original power calculations, we planned to
 have between 51 and 53 sub-counties in each treatment cell (corresponding
 to about 2,550 to 2,650 households).
 At the start of the end-line data collection, 29 sub-counties of the 51
 that were supposed to receive the information-only treatment were treated,
 18 sub-counties of the 51 that were supposed to receive the deliberation-only
 treatment were treated, and 20 sub-counties of the 53 that were supposed
 to receive the crossed (information + deliberation) treatment were treated.
 All eight districts that were supposed to be treated were treated, from
 which 40 sub-counties were sampled.
 Overall, this means that about 55 percent of the sub-counties that needed
 to receive any form of baraza were treated, corresponding to about 5,350
 households.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Statistical power is optimal when the number of treatment units is equal
 to the number of control units, and while adding more control sub-counties
 will increase power, the gains in power must be weighed against the cost
 of collecting additional data.
 As only part of the sub-county-level intervention was implemented, it may
 thus not be cost effective to collect end-line data on all sub-counties
 that did not receive a treatment (either because they were allocated to
 the control or because they ended up not being treated).
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We decided to collect end-line data on 40 control sub-counties, which is
 equal to the number of sub-counties that was treated with a district-level
 baraza (the largest number of sub-counties among the different treatments).
\end_layout

\end_inset

 This raises the question: From the potential control sub-counties (either
 those that were allocated to the control or because they ended up not being
 treated), which sub-counties should be included in the end-line data collection
? One reasonable suggestion would be to pick them randomly.
 However, also here, if the roll-out was not random, such a strategy may
 lead to a biased estimate of the causal impact of the intervention.
 For instance, if the OPM prioritized treatment of less remote areas, randomly
 selecting control sub-counties may result in a sample in which sub-counties
 in less remote locations are relatively under-represented and sub-counties
 that are in more remote areas relatively over-represented in the control
 group.
 A better strategy may be to match each treated sub-county to a control
 sub-county that is similar in a range of observable pre-treatment characteristi
cs that the planner had access to when the intervention was rolled out and
 are likely to have affected his or her decision

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We used a range of sub-county characteristics that were likely to be known
 to the planner and may have affected how the intervention was rolled out
 to match each treated sub-county to a control sub-county that was similar
 in terms of these characteristics.
 More in particular, we match on the following characteristics that were
 obtained at baseline from a survey of village chairs and CAOs of each sub-count
y: Geographic location of the sub-county using GPS coordinates of the headquarte
rs, road infrastructure within the sub-county (km tarmac road and km all-weather
 (gravel) road), share of households with electricity, share of households
 with an iron roof or tiles, number of health centers in the sub-county,
 female primary school dropout rate, number of Universal Primary Education
 (UPE) schools in the sub-county, percent of farmers that used improved
 seed, and political connections of the sub-county (defined by having a
 minister or member of parliament coming from the sub-county).
 These characteristics are used in a probit regression to predict the probabilit
y that a sub-county would be treated.
 The probabilities are then used to match each treated sub-county to a candidate
 control sub-county that is closest in terms of the predicted probability
 of being treated.
 Table

 shows baseline balance for the resulting sample.
 Two significant results out of 40 comparisons are again what can be expected
 from pure chance alone and so we conclude that also with this new sample
 we maintain balance between treatment and control on a range of baseline
 characteristics for the various comparisons.
 It is important to note that this matching was done before end-line data
 was collected and the result of this ex-ante matching was also pre-registered

\begin_layout Standard
While the ex-ante matching strategy may reduce bias resulting from incomplete
 roll-out, there are also costs involved.
 First, if sample selection is introduced by the roll-out, matching may
 further reduce external validity of the study, as now also the control
 sub-counties are not a random sample of the study population anymore.
 Second, the reduction in potential bias for hypotheses related to the sub-count
y-level barazas should be traded off against an increase in potential bias
 when testing differences between control and district-level barazas.
 As the sub-county-level analysis weighed higher in terms of research objectives
, we decided to prioritize the reduction of bias resulting from incomplete
 roll-out at this level.
 However, it should be kept in mind that both issues only become relevant
 if significant selection bias was introduced through the partial roll-out.

 From a policy perspective, in light of the shift from sub-county-level
 barazas to district-level barazas from 2012 onward, the last comparison
 is the most interesting one, and this comparison was pre-registered.
 However, the partial roll-out of the intervention (see section

 Comparisons of outcomes in areas that received a district-level baraza
 treatment to areas that did not receive a baraza have more statistical

 It shows results for the four main hypotheses—the impact of the sub-county
 baraza, the relative effectiveness of the information component, the relative
 effectiveness of the deliberation component, and the impact of district-level
 barazas—on four sectors we consider—agriculture, infrastructure, health,
 and education.
 As mentioned above, the graphs are based on indices that are composed of
 various outcomes in each sector as a first line of defense against the
 problem of multiple comparisons

This method first reconstructs a complete schedule of potential outcomes
 by adding and subtracting the average treatment effect for control and
 treated units respectively.
 These potential outcomes are then used to simulate all possible random
 allocations.
 For each allocation, average treatment effects are estimated and 2.5th and
 97.5th percentiles are then taken as the lower and upper limits of the 95
 percent confidence interval.
 As this provides a conservative estimate of the confidence interval, it
 may be that results in the graph appear insignificant, but do show up as
 significant when testing significance using Fisher's exact test in the
 tables in Online Appendix A.4.

\end_inset

 We also combine the four indices into one overall index that assesses the
 impact on public service delivery in general.
 We find no significant impact of the baraza program on overall public service
 delivery.
 There are some indications that sub-county-level barazas did make a difference
 in the agricultural sector, though only at the 10 percent significance
 level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The indices combine various outcomes, and for some of them the expected
 direction of the effect is unclear a-priori.
 For instance, an information baraza may increase the quality of services
 in a hospital or health center when judged by an objective measure such
 as waiting time.
 However, the information may also result in higher expectations from the
 part of the user.
 As such, perceptions of quality may have reduced as a result of an information
 baraza.
 It is therefore also interesting to look beyond the indices and consider
 outcomes individually.
 In Online Appendix A.4, we thus provide a detailed and more exploratory
 analysis of the individual outcomes behind these indices, and some other
 outcomes that were not pre-registered.
 This analysis suggests some additional impact from sub-county-level barazas
 in some areas (such as schooling infrastructure or waiting time at boreholes).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main conclusion from our confirmatory analysis is in line with what
 most other studies find: There is no significant impact of the policy program
 on public service delivery as a whole 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "raffler2018weakness,olken2007monitoring,waddington2019citizen"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 In this section, we explore some of the potential reasons why barazas do
 not seem to translate into large overall or sector-wide improvements in
 public service delivery.
 We categorize potential reasons under three headings: problems with the
 theory of change, the political context in which the program was implemented,
 and methodological challenges in evaluating real world policy interventions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Problems with the theory of change
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Community-based monitoring interventions such as the baraza program can
 only improve public service delivery if there is room for improvement:
 If politicians are already responsive to the needs of citizens and civil
 servants are delivering services of high quality, a baraza intervention
 is unlikely to have any significant additional effect on objectively verifiable
 outcomes such as waiting time in health centers or student-teacher ratios
 (however, a baraza could still change citizens' perceptions of public service
 delivery—see below).
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Indeed, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

\end_inset

 argue that the fact that child mortality reduced significantly in response
 to the community-based monitoring intervention in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "bjorkman2009power"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 but not in their study is likely due to the fact that child mortality improved
 substantially over the last few decades, leaving little room for further
 improvement.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 We think it is hard to argue that service delivery in Uganda cannot be
 improved.
 While progress has been made in some areas such as child mortality, other
 areas have seen less improvement.
 For instance, only about 10 percent of households report that they have
 access to agricultural extension (see Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Balance_planed_ctrl"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 Data obtained from our baseline survey shows that patients at government
 health centers must wait for medical examination for almost two hours on
 average and are examined by a nurse instead of a doctor in many cases.
 Access to water remains problematic, especially in the dry season when
 36 percent of households turn to potentially unsafe drinking water.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Alternatively, if there are no funds available for public service delivery,
 community-based monitoring will most likely not lead to the desired outcomes.
 Also here, we think that lack of funding is not the main issue.
 The liberalization and decentralization drive in the mid-eighties seduced
 donors across the globe to pour money into Ugandan public services.
 While there have been some studies reporting rampant elite capture 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
before "for example,"
key "reinikka2004local"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, we asked government officials in all sub-counties of our sample during
 our baseline survey about the proportion of their public service budget
 that they actually received for the fiscal year 2013/2014, and they reported
 to have received on average 83 percent of their health and education budgets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The impact of the baraza program will also likely be muted if priorities
 of officials are not aligned with priorities of citizens.
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Note that unaligned priorities do not fully explain why barazas have no
 effect: It may still be that services improve, but in sectors which citizens
 do not perceive as most problematic.
 However, assuming citizens know best where most progress can be made, unaligned
 priorities may reduce effectiveness of the barazas.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 For priorities to be aligned, it is important that what is discussed during
 the barazas is also what citizens think is most important.
 This may not automatically be the case, as the most vocal individuals may
 dominate the discussion due to group dynamics and attempt to skew decisions
 during the meeting in their favor.
 To explore the alignment between what citizens deem important and what
 transpires at the baraza event, we would need detailed information about
 what was discussed and concluded during the meetings in addition to the
 baseline information of what citizens perceive as important.
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Alignment"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 uses information obtained from reports redacted by the OPM for 10 random
 sub-county-level baraza events.
 Using these reports, we determine for each baraza which sector was most
 discussed (column 4).
 This is then compared to baseline data on priorities obtained from citizens
 living in that sub-county (column 3).
 We find that what is prioritized by citizens is also discussed in the baraza
 in four out of 10 sub-counties.
 This suggests some degree of alignment between priorities of citizens and
 what is discussed during the baraza event.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even if what transpires in a baraza reflects the priorities of the citizens,
 there will be no impact if officials subsequently do not act on this.
 To explore this link in the causal impact chain, we added to Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Alignment"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 a column where for each of the 10 sub-counties we report in what sector
 most positive changes were recorded during end-line.
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We do this based on the indices that we created earlier to measure impact
 at sector level (see Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Results"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\end_inset

 We find that in only two out of 10 sub-counties, the sector that was discussed
 most during the baraza event was also the sector where most positive change
 was recorded.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Alignment"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 thus suggests that while priorities of citizens do seem to get discussed
 during barazas, it is less common that what was decided also gets implemented.
 Using focus group discussions, we gauged reasons why this link breaks down.
 Firstly, poor relationships between politicians and technical personnel
 can hinder the effectiveness of barazas.
 For example, a poor relation or communication between a CAO and a LC5 Chairpers
on can impede public service delivery.
 Secondly, if barazas mainly expose issues beyond the accountability of
 the officials and service providers present, they will not be conducive
 for service provision.
 Some issues fall under the responsibility of higher levels of government
 or other institutions that are beyond the operational jurisdiction of people
 present at the barazas.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, it may also be that barazas do not lead to changes in public service
 delivery, but that there still is a change in use and appreciation by the
 citizens.
 During qualitative research, we found that government officials, and particular
ly civil servants, often complained that barazas should also contain an
 element of “civic education”.
 Providing information about the nature of public services and the limitations
 of what public servants can do may help manage the expectations of citizens,
 in turn increasing their use.
 One example given was that citizens complain that they still become sick
 after drinking water from boreholes that were installed by government.
 The officials responsible for water and infrastructure objected that citizens
 need to treat water (for example, by boiling or using chlorine), even if
 it comes from a borehole.
 If this information would be available to citizens, perhaps their expectations
 would be more aligned with what public servants deliver.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To explore this civic education function of barazas, we test if, even though
 there is no impact on objectively verifiable outcomes, the baraza intervention
 affected perceptions by citizens.
 In particular, we asked citizens to rate, on a Likert scale, how satisfied
 they were with public service delivery in the four sectors.
 We find some indications that a combined information and deliberation baraza
 improved citizens satisfaction related to access to water.
 Satisfaction about schooling also improved but is just not significant.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 function of baraza may also explain why 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "raffler2018weakness"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 find that their health focused community monitoring intervention significantly
 increased satisfaction without affecting outcomes.
 As such, town hall-style meetings may still be beneficial even if they
 do not lead to real changes in public service delivery.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Political context
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The structure of the baraza and the political environment in which it is
 organized, may also affect its effectiveness.
 Indeed, drawing on a systematic review of over 90 social accountability
 interventions, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "doi:10.1080/00220388.2015.1134778"

 argue that politics and context are critical to shaping their success.
 In Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Ugandan-baraza-program"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, we saw that the meetings are chaired by the RDC who represents the ruling
 party.
 Barazas are also organized by the OPM, an office of which several officials
 have appeared in the news in the context of large corruption scandals over
 the last decade.
 These facts may mean that certain groups in society (such as people who
 vote for the opposition) perceive barazas very differently.
 Furthermore, government officials may abuse these fora to pursue their
 own agenda and reports indeed indicate that barazas sometimes turn into
 political rallies, especially when elections are approaching.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We explore the impact of political context by looking at treatment heterogeneity
 related to connections to people in power.
 The assumption is that support for government is likely to be higher in
 sub-counties that deliver higher level (district of central level) politicians,
 such as minister, member of parliament, heads of government agencies, RDCs,
 and other district-level officials.
 We would expect that in these areas, barazas are more effective, since
 citizens can use their connections to the center to attract funding to
 issues raised, and politicians may want to reward their constituents.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:connections"

\end_inset

 reports interaction effects of the different interventions with an indicator
 for sub-counties that are more connected to the center and likely to be
 more pro-government.
 We do not find significant interaction effects based on the indices.
 However, coefficients are generally positive, especially for interactions
 with the deliberation focused sub-county baraza and district-level barazas.
 Examples of positive interaction effects for individual outcomes reported
 in the

 include an increased likelihood of visiting extension offices, demonstration
 sites or model farmers and an increase in the likelihood that schools have
 a fence after a deliberation focused baraza.
 We also find a reduction in the use of unprotected water sources after
 a sub-county-level baraza.

 surrounding the baraza program.
 We also argued that the primary concerns of the partial roll-out, namely
 non-random roll-out and reduced sample size, are unlikely to affect our
 conclusions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this sub-section, we focus on treatment heterogeneity as a potential
 reason why we do not find more convincing impact.
 This is inspired by the observation, even though we do not find an overall
 impact on public service delivery, effects often go in the right direction,
 and we do find some significant effects if we consider individual outcomes
 in Online Appendix A.4.
 Focus group discussions with citizens in a few sub-counties where barazas
 were held also indicated barazas were perceived as highly effective; they
 provided various examples of changes in public service delivery that they
 thought were due to, or accelerated by, the baraza event.
 All this suggests that impact from a barazas may be highly localized and
 context specific.
 
\end_layout

 Barazas are fairly broad interventions that attempt to address a range

 unlikely to be standardized across treatment units, at least compared to
 typical treatments in biomedical sciences

 A baraza in one sub-county (where drinking water infrastructure is a problem)
 may evolve in a very different direction than a baraza in another sub-county
 (where problems may be more in health care).
 Both barazas may be effective in their own right (fixing water issues in
 one case and fixing health cares issues in the second case), yet outcomes
 are averaged over treatment units, and impact is diluted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To improve governance and public service delivery in Uganda, the OPM organizes
 town hall-style meetings—popularly known as barazas—where citizens receive
 information from government officials and get the opportunity to directly
 engage with them.
 In 2015, we designed a cluster RCT aimed at evaluating the effectiveness
 of this policy intervention.
 The study set out to answer four research questions: (1) What is the impact
 of the baraza as originally designed and implemented by the OPM? (2) What
 is the relative effectiveness of the information component of a baraza?
 (3) What is the relative effectiveness of the deliberative component of
 a baraza? And: (4) Should a baraza be organized at the district level or
 at the sub-county level? Baseline data from more than 12,500 households
 spread over almost 250 sub-counties in about 40 districts throughout Uganda
 was collected and the OPM started implementing barazas following our experiment
al design and protocols.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The OPM faced various challenges that affected the timely roll-out of the
 barazas, including budgetary constraints and disruptions related to the
 general elections of 2016.
 This resulted in the decision to collect end-line information after partial
 roll-out, more than four years after baseline data was collected.
 Various strategies were followed to diagnose, and reduce the consequences
 of, potential selection bias and sample size reduction introduced by this
 partial roll out.
 Early 2020, end-line data was collected on 6,700 households.
 We find that the partial roll-out did not introduce significant bias and,
 judged by a series of Minimal Detectable Effect simulations, we conclude
 that we retain reasonable statistical power.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Judged by an index of overall public service delivery, we find no significant
 impact of the program.
 There are some indications that sub-county-level barazas had a positive
 impact on service delivery in the agricultural sector.
 We then consider various potential reasons why barazas did not have the
 expected sector-wide benefits.
 We find indications of problems in the theory of change: while priorities
 of citizens do seem to get discussed during barazas, solutions are not
 always implemented.
 Furthermore the political context in which barazas are organized seemed
 to have mattered to some extent.
 We also reflect on challenges in implementing and evaluating large scale
 policy interventions with heterogeneous treatments and associated effects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our findings are in line with a recent studies by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 that fails to replicate 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "bjorkman2009power"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 with more data.
 More in general, initial high hopes about the potential for community engagemen
t to improve public service delivery seems to have been reduced as more
 empirical evidence becomes available.
 In a recent mixed-methods systematic review of participation, inclusion,
 transparency and accountability (PITA) initiatives, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "waddington2019citizen"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 suggest that citizen engagement may have positive effects on improving
 intermediate user engagement outcomes such as meeting attendance and improve
 access to and quality of certain public services.
 At the same time, effects on public service outcomes such as education
 levels or child health are limited.
 Citizen participation often also did not lead to changes in service provider
 action outcomes such as public spending, staff motivation and corruption.
 More research is needed to identify pre-conditions and complementary interventi
ons needed to leverage the voices of citizens.
