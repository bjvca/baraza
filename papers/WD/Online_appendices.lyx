In Table

, we test for balance between the treatment groups at baseline following
 the original design of the experiment.
 Baseline data on 12,545 households was collected between June and September
 2015.
 Sample averages are reported in the first column (with standard errors
 in brackets below).
 For example, we see that the average household consists of about

 percent of households report that they had access to agricultural extension.
 In the second column, we report differences between baseline characteristics
 of households that were, according to the original design, planned to receive
 a sub-county level combined information and deliberation baraza, and those
 that would not be exposed to any baraza.
 We find that distance to the nearest road is slightly—though statistically
 significantly—higher in areas that were planned to receive a sub-county
 level baraza.
 When comparing households that were planned to be exposed to a sub-county
 level information baraza to households that would not receive a sub-county
 level information baraza (column 3), we see that that households are slightly
 larger in the former group, and the difference is significant.
 The average household has two to three children attending a public school.
 We also find a slight pre-treatment imbalance on this outcome for the informati
on treatment.

 In the last column, we report differences in outcomes between households

 not be exposed to any baraza.
 Also here, we do not find any significant difference.
 Overall, out of 40 comparisons, we find that two differences are significant,
 which is what one would expect to find due to chance alone.
 As such, we conclude that the randomization of the original design was
 successful.

The partial roll-out means a reduction in statistical power.
 In this section, we use baseline data to simulate an updated set of minimal
 detectable effects (MDEs) for the outcomes that were pre-registered to
 be used to judge effectiveness of the intervention.
 Instead of fixing MDEs and simulating power for different sample sizes
 as is usually done in power calculations, we fix sample size to what we

 ended up with after partial roll-out and simulate power for different MDEs.
 We use a standard significance level of 0.05 (double sided).
 MDEs are estimated using a simple analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model
 that controls for the outcome at baseline and accounts for the clustered
 nature of the intervention.

 The gray solid line shows the power curve associated with the deliberation
 treatment, comparing 18 sub-counties that received the deliberation only
 treatment to 40 pure control sub-counties, which corresponds to a sample
 of about 2,900 households.
 The light blue dashed line shows power for different MDEs for the information
 component of the baraza intervention.
 Here, we compare 29 sub-counties that received an information focused baraza
 to 40 control sub-counties, corresponding to about 3,450 households.
 We also investigate power for the comparison between pure control barazas
 and sub-county level barazas (black dotted line).
 Here we compare about 1,000 households in the 20 sub-counties that received
 the combined information and deliberation treatment to about 2,000 households
 that did not receive any baraza (in the 40 pure control sub-counties).
 Finally, the dark blue dashed line plots power for the comparison between
 about 2,000 households in 40 pure control sub-counties and about 2,000
 households that were exposed to a district level baraza (sampled from 40
 sub-counties in these districts).

While power curves are generally not too different, we seem to have most
 power for testing the information treatment.
 We see that the power curve hits the 80 percent threshold for the first
 time at an MDE of about 3.7 percentage points.
 The deliberation experiment is similarly powered, and at 80 percent we
 can expect to identify effects of 3.75 percentage points or more.
 Due to the smaller sample size, it is harder to compare pure control sub-counti
es to sub-county barazas that received the interacted treatment.

 Still, we can comfortably identify an increase of 4 percentage points.
 Despite a larger sample size available to test the impact of district level
 barazas, we find power to be comparable to that of the sub-county level
 baraza.
 This is due to the clustering at a much more aggregated level.

As more than four years passed between baseline and endline data collection,
 some level of attrition was to be expected.
 Overall, attrition amounted to 8.6 percent.
 Reports from the field indicated that this attrition was due to the fact

 that some villages that were close to Lake Victoria had been evacuated
 due to rising levels of the lake.
 Two villages in areas populated with land insecure settlers were dropped
 due to security issues.
 Finally, attrition was generally higher in urban areas, as households that
 were residing in rented properties returned to their villages.

 of barazas in changing service delivery and associated outcomes in agriculture.
 Results are reported in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

.

 We start by looking if the baraza program affected the use of modern inputs
 in agriculture.
 A first outcome looks at whether the household used inorganic fertilizers
 (DAP, Urea, NPK, Foliar, TSP, SSP, MOP) during the last 12 months, an important
 yield increasing technology.
 The first column reports sample averages, with standard deviation in brackets
 below.
 We find that about

 percent of households in the sample gave an affirmative answer to this
 question.
 In the second column, we report differences in outcomes between households
 that received a sub-county level baraza and households that did not receive
 any baraza (
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset


 as estimated using the Ordinary Least Squares model in Equation (1) in
 the paper).
 We see that the proportion of households that reported using inorganic
 fertilizer is

 percentage points lower among the sub-group of households that were exposed
 to a sub-county level baraza that consists of both the information and
 the deliberation component than among households that did not receive any
 baraza.
 However, this difference is not statistically significant.
 In the third column, we report differences between outcomes of households
 that live in areas where an information baraza was organized and outcomes
 of households that live in areas that were not exposed to a baraza.
 We see that adoption of inorganic fertilizer was

 percentage points higher among households that were exposed to an information
 focused baraza.
 However, also here, the difference is not significant.
 In the fourth column, we report differences between outcomes of households
 that live in areas where a deliberation baraza was organized and outcomes
 of households that live in areas that were not exposed to a baraza.
 We also do not find differences in terms of inorganic fertilizer use.
 Finally, in the fifth column, we compare households that were exposed to
 a district level baraza to pure control households.
 Again, no impact of the district level baraza is found on this outcome.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second outcome is related to the use of improved seed, a second important
 yield improving technology promoted by the government.
 This input seemed to be used more widely than inorganic fertilizer:

 sub-county level baraza took place as opposed to in areas where no baraza
 was conducted, but the difference is not significant.

], so it is unclear if this null result really signifies the absence of
 an effect, or if it is due to small sample size.
 We find negative point estimates for the relative effects of both the informati
on and the deliberation component, but effects are imprecisely estimated.
 Finally, we find adoption of improved seed was lower in areas where a district
 level baraza was conducted, but the difference with areas that did not
 receive a baraza is not significant.
 Adoption of improved seed and inorganic fertilizer was included in the
 index to judge impact on the agricultural sector in Figure 3 of the paper.

 percentage points higher in areas where a sub-county level baraza took
 place.
 We further see that this is especially due to the deliberation component
 of sub-county level barazas.
 In areas where such a baraza was held, the share is

 percentage points higher than in areas where citizens were not given the
 opportunity to engage with their leaders.
 We find no such effects from district level barazas.
 Direct comparison of district and sub-county level barazas indicate that
 sub-county level barazas are significantly more effective in increasing
 the likelihood that households reported to have received these inputs from
 government.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We then check if household changed with respect to the use of agrochemicals.
 This includes the use of pesticides, herbicides, fungicides and acaricides
 during the 12 months prior to endline data collection.
 Overall, almost half of all households in the sample reported using some
 form of agrochemicals.
 We do not find evidence that the baraza intervention affected the use of
 these inputs.
 Finally, we consider the use of modern inputs and methods in livestock
 rearing over the last 12 months.
 This includes improved animal breeds, the use of modern feeds, drugs, and
 artificial insemination.

 percent of households report that they used such inputs, and this proportion
 is similar across different experimental groups.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We then turn to agricultural advisory services.
 We first investigate if barazas affected access to extension at home.
 We estimate the percentage of households in our sample who reported that
 they were visited by an expert (for example, crop or livestock extension
 agent, or community-based facilitator or another experienced farmer) at
 home in the last 12 months.
 We find that access to extension, although higher than at baseline, is
 still low, with only about

\begin_layout Plain Layout

Sexpr{format(round(df_averages[1,8],digits=2)*100,nsmall=0)}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 percent of households reporting that they received such a visit.
 We find that this percentage is significantly higher among households that
 were exposed to a sub-county level baraza.
 The effect is large, amounting to an increase of

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
Sexpr{format(abs(round(df_ancova[1,1,8],digits=3)*100),nsmall=1)}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 percentage points.
 The effect seems to come from a combination of the information and deliberation
 components; the components themselves do not seem to affect the outcome
 enough to render if significant.
 We also find that this effect is absent among households that live in sub-count
ies that received the district level baraza.
 A direct comparison of extension at home between households that were exposed
 to a district level baraza and households that were exposed to a sub-county
 level baraza confirms that sub-county level barazas were significantly
 more effective.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Home visits by extension officers are not the only way in which households
 have access to information.
 Extension offices, demonstration sites and model farmers are also an integral
 part of the Ugandan agricultural advisory system.
 Especially after the establishment of NAADS, such a demand-led service
 component that can be consulted by farmers when the need arises became
 more important than the more supply-driven component of training and visit.
 We thus also inquire if anyone in the household visited an extension office,
 demonstration site, or model farmer in the year preceding endline data
 collection.
 We find that about 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

Sexpr{format(round(df_averages[1,9],digits=2)*100,nsmall=0)}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 percent of households in our sample reported access to extension in this
 way.
 While the results are in line with extension visits at home, differences
 are not significant.
 Access to extension, both at home or though extension offices and demonstration
 sites, was also included as a key outcome to assess impact using in the
 agricultural sector index.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find that three quarters of households in our sample mention that there
 were agricultural enterprises, improved technologies or inputs they would
 like to adopt, indicating significant demand for advisory services.
 We also find that, according to citizens, service providers and policy
 makers were not always aware of the needs of farmers.
 The table shows that only

\end_inset

 percent of households believed that officials were aware of which services
 farmers need.
 While we do not see that this percentage differs between treatment and
 control for sub-county level barazas, we do see that a district level baraza
 reduced this percentage.
 This may indicate that a district level baraza made the mismatch between
 what farmers need and what officials think farmers need more salient.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Related to the previous outcome, we asked how decisions related to what
 topics to cover in agricultural extension are made.
 We define this outcome in a negative way, that is, the indicator is true
 if decisions are made without consultation.
 We see that about

 percent of households reported the presence of farmer groups or cooperatives
 in their village.
 In the agricultural sector in Uganda, such groups are very important.
 They are actively promoted by the government.
 In fact, to be able to receive inputs from the government extension system,
 farmers are strongly encouraged to form such groups.
 We find that sub-county level barazas increased the likelihood that farmer
 cooperatives or groups were formed in the villages in Uganda.
 It seems that the deliberative component is the main driver behind this
 result.
 We also find that this effect was specific to interventions at the sub-county
 level.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We further find that a higher share of farmer groups in areas that received
 a sub-county level baraza received support from government.
 NAADS, and more recently OWC, are responsible for the distribution of subsidize
d agricultural inputs.

 The Office of the Prime Minister (OPM) reports from the baraza meetings
 indicate that there are often many complaints related to the absence of
 NAADS/OWC in sub-counties and the non-transparent way in which decisions
 are made on who gets to benefit from NAADS/OWC and who does not get inputs.
 We see that

 While the opportunity of households to engage with officials seems to be

The final two questions focus more on marketing.
 Connecting farmers to markets is also an important strategy outlined in
 the Agriculture Sector Strategic Plan (ASSP).
 The first outcome relates to the likelihood that farmers were supported
 by government through a village procurement committee.
 In the sample, about

 A second questions is similar but looked at the role of cooperatives in
 marketing support.

 for an increase of almost

 percentage points in the likelihood that cooperatives assisted with marketing
 in areas that received a sub-county baraza.
 However, simulated MDEs suggest these results may suffer from a lack of
 statistical power.

 Both outcomes were also included in the index to assess agricultural sector
 impact.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Infrastructure
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A second important area in which we expect to see an impact of the baraza
 program is infrastructure.
 We primarily focus on drinking water infrastructure.
 Results are in Table

A first outcome we consider is whether the household used an unprotected
 water source during the dry season.
 This is measured as the share of households that reported that the main
 source of drinking water during the dry season was surface water, an unprotecte
d dug well, or an unprotected spring.
 We find that about

 percent of households in the sample reported that they were using an unprotecte
d water source.
 The baraza intervention did not seem to affect this proportion.
 This outcome is included in the infrastructure index shown in Figure 3
 of the article.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A second outcome we look at (and is also included in the index) is the distance
 to the primary water source during the dry season.

 This was measured in km but trimmed and transformed using the inverse hyperboli
c sine transformation.
 We find that, on average, households had to walk about

 km.
 While this distance seemed to reduce in all comparisons, and especially
 for barazas held at the district level where we find a reduction of approximate
ly 9 percent, it is never significantly different from zero.

 are probably not due to limited power.

The third outcome, also part of the index, is the time that one must wait
 at the water source, measured in minutes.
 This continuous variable was also trimmed and transformed.
 We find that households must wait on average about

 We find that waiting time in areas that were exposed to the sub-county
 level baraza intervention reduced by about 25 percent.
 The deliberation component seems to be mostly responsible for this reduction.

The fourth outcome variable assesses changes in the presence of a water
 user committee in the village.

 percent of households reported that such a committee was present in their
 village.
 We do not find that this share varies between the different experimental
 groups, but comparison of estimated coefficients to simulated MDEs suggests
 power is an issue.
 Consistent with the finding that deliberation has been found to increase
 subsequent citizen involvement in community affairs 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, we see that the deliberation component led to an increase in the likelihood
 that a household member was a member of a water user committee.
 We do not find that the baraza intervention increased the likelihood that
 these committees hold public meetings.
 Only the first of these three outcomes was pre-registered and included
 in the index.

Households were also asked if they were satisfied with the quality of the
 water that was available at the source during the dry season.

 percent responded that they were satisfied or very satisfied with the drinking
 water.
 We do not find that households that were exposed to the baraza intervention
 were more or less likely to report that they were (very) satisfied with
 the quality of drinking water during the dry season.
 Half of the households reported that they treated drinking water before
 drinking it, either by boiling it or treating it with chlorine.
 The likelihood that households treated water reduced somewhat for the informati
on treatment.
 This may be due to the belief held in many households that water from a
 safe source does not need additional treatment.

We included one question related to road infrastructure.
 We asked how far the household is located from the nearest all weather
 road.
 We find that in the full sample a household lived on average 26 km from
 a road.
 We do not find that the baraza program reduced the distance to the nearest
 all weather road.

\begin_layout Subsection
Health
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We now look at outcomes in the health sphere (Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:anova_health"

\end_inset

).
 One problem with public health related outcomes is that some outcomes related
 to quality-of-service delivery in health centers will only be available
 for households that have visited government health facilities, reducing
 sample size too much to maintain acceptable power.
 Furthermore, the intervention may also affect the likelihood that households
 visit a government health facility, potentially introducing selection bias.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first two outcomes we consider attempt to assess changes in access or
 use of public health facilities.
 A first indicator measures demand for public health services for illness.
 In particular, we construct an indicator that is true if the household
 head responded that treatment would be sought in a health center 2, 3,
 4 or in a regional referral hospital if a member of his/her household had
 fever.
 We find that 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
Sexpr{format(round(df_averages[1,25]*100,digits=0),nsmall=0)}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 percent of households responded that they would seek treatment in a government
 health facility.
 This proportion is independent of the treatment groups.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A similar indicator attempts to assess demand for public health services
 for maternal health care, and asks if treatment would be sought in a health
 center 2, 3, 4 or in a regional referral hospital if a member of the household
 was to give birth.
 This percentage was even higher: about 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
Sexpr{format(round(df_averages[1,26]*100,digits=0),nsmall=0)}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 percent would go to a government health facility to give birth.
 Again, this proportion was not affected by the baraza program.
 Both outcomes are included in the health index.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, we asked if a Village Health Team (VHT) was present in the village.
 VHTs are very important in front-line health care provision in Uganda.
 They also have prominent roles in government health interventions, such
 as immunization campaigns or the distribution of bed nets.
 We find that overall, about 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
Sexpr{format(round(df_averages[1,27]*100,digits=0),nsmall=0)}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 percent of households reported that a VHT was present in their village.
 The presence of a VHT was not impacted by the baraza intervention.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the baraza tries to increase citizen engagement, we also checked if household
s that were exposed to a baraza are more likely to participate in VHTs.
 We thus asked if any member of the household was a member of a VHT.
 We see that in about 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
Sexpr{format(round(df_averages[1,28]*100,digits=0),nsmall=0)}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 percent of our sample, at least one household member was part of a VHT.
 The baraza intervention did not increase the likelihood that individuals
 participated as VHT members.
 Furthermore, the baraza intervention attempts to encourage sharing of informati
on.
 As such, we expect that being exposed to a baraza may encourage VHTs to
 organize more public meetings.
 We find that overall, 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
Sexpr{format(round(df_averages[1,29]*100,digits=0),nsmall=0)}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 percent of households stated that VHTs organized a public meeting in the
 preceding year.
 We find that this proportion was significantly higher in areas that were
 exposed to a sub-county level baraza.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also consider distance to the nearest government health facility, measured
 in km (trimmed and transformed using the inverse hyperbolic sine transformation
).
 Overall, average distance to the nearest government health facility was
 almost 50 km.
 We do not find that barazas reduced this distance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We then turn to health outcomes.
 We started by asking if any member of the household fell sick during the
 year prior to endline data collection.
 This was the case in two thirds of the households in our sample.
 The intervention did not reduce morbidity in our sample.
 We then asked for each sick person in the household to record how many
 days he or she was ill and use this to calculate the total number of sick
 days at the household level in the last year.
 The average household recorded almost 50 sick days according to this definition.
 We also do not find that the intervention affected the (trimmed and transformed
) number of sick days.
 We also look at the number of days household members were unable to go
 to school or to work, which provides an indication of the severity of illness.
 Calculated similarly to the previous outcome, we find that in the average
 household about 35 school- or workdays were missed due to illness.
 Again, there was no significant reduction in this (trimmed and transformed)
 number.
 This last health outcome measure is included in the health index.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, we asked how long one had to wait before being attended to (in minutes,
 trimmed and transformed).
 We find that the sample mean for this outcome is about 90 minutes.
 While we see that waiting time reduced for most comparisons, the differences
 are never significant.
 However, we only have sufficient power to confidently claim null effects
 for the components of the sub-county level baraza, not for the combined
 sub-county level baraza.
 This outcome was also included in the health index.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next question that was included in the index was again asked to all
 households.
 In particular, we inquired if a traditional health practitioner was consulted
 in the last year.
 In one in four households in our sample, this was the case.
 The baraza intervention did not affect this percentage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One problem that often crops up in the health sector is absenteeism 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "10.1257/089533006776526139"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 To assess this, we asked who examined the patient in the health center.
 Ideally this should be the doctor or in-charge.
 If this person was absent, patients were generally examined by nurses or
 lab technicians.
 We thus construct an indicator that is one if the household responds that
 the patient was investigated by the doctor or the in-charge, and zero otherwise.
 Only in 
\begin_inset ERT

Sexpr{format(round(df_averages[1,36]*100,digits=0),nsmall=0)}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 percent of the cases, a qualified person appeared to do the examination.
 Surprisingly, the deliberation component of the baraza seems to reduce
 this likelihood somewhat.
 We also look at the time that the examination takes.
 The average examination in our sample took about 22 minutes.
 There is no change related to the intervention.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Health care in Uganda is supposed to be free.
 However, corruption is widespread and often patients are required to make
 payments to receive care.
 We find that about 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

Sexpr{format(round(df_averages[1,38]*100,digits=0),nsmall=0)}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 percent of households reported that payment was required the last time
 they visited a government health facility.
 There was no impact of the intervention.
 Related, users often complained about a lack of drugs in government health
 facilities.
 We asked if, during the last visit to a government health center, drugs
 were received (indicating that drugs were available).
 We also asked if drugs had to be purchased from outside of the hospital
 (indicating that at least some drugs were missing).
 While 
\begin_inset ERT

\end_layout

\end_inset

 percent of households reported that they received medicines in the health
 center, almost all of them also mentioned that they had to also buy drugs
 outside of the hospital.
 For neither indicator, the intervention seems to make a difference.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We further probe for a subjective assessment of the overall quality of care
 at the health facility.
 Most households reported that they were satisfied or very satisfied with
 services received at the government health facility.
 This seemed to increase in areas where a sub-county level baraza took place
 and there is also a sizable difference in outcomes when comparing sub-county
 level baraza outcomes to district level baraza outcomes.
 However, none of the differences are significant.

 is immunization.
 However, we already find close to 100 percent immunization rates in our

 Another outcome is child mortality.
 Child mortality rates at baseline were estimated at 38 per 1000 live births,
 which was deemed too low to include in the analysis.

\begin_layout Standard
Education outcomes to assess impact of the intervention suffers from a similar
 problem as the one encountered with health outcomes: not all households
 in the sample had children in school, and so for many of the outcomes related
 to education, sample size becomes small.
 This also affects the indices.
 Results are presented in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the quality of public education is poor, households will be less likely
 to send their children to public schools.
 A first obvious outcome is thus to simply compare the number of children
 within the household that attended public schools (either Universal Primary
 Education or Universal Secondary Education).
 We find that the average household in our sample had almost two children
 in government schools, but that enrollment rates were not affected by the
 baraza intervention, although for all but the information component, we
 cannot differentiate between null effects and insignificant results due
 to low statistical power.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Access to public education is also influenced by the distance to a public
 school.
 We thus recorded distance to primary or secondary school (or the average
 if both are reported; trimmed and transformed).
 We find that on average, households lived about 3 km from a government
 operated school.
 Also for this outcome, the baraza program did not make an impact, but estimated
 coefficients are below MDEs and so insignificance may be due to small sample
 size.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also look at school infrastructure.
 First, we asked households if the primary or secondary school attended
 by any of their children had a complete boundary fence.
 In the complete sample, it was reported that only about

 percent of schools have such a fence.
 The lack of a fence was a frequent complaint from parents during qualitative
 work.
 We also asked if the school had electricity and if there was a water source
 available in the school.
 We find that overall, about

 percent had a water source.
 We find that sub-county level baraza seem to improve school infrastructure.
 We considered many other infrastructure related outcomes, such as the number
 of classrooms and availability of functioning toilets for both girls and
 boys, but baseline data suggested there were generally no issues related
 to these outcomes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also look at how the schools were managed, and how parents were involved.
 For instance, we look at whether the school had a Parent Teacher Association
 (PTA) and a School Management Committee (SMC).
 Almost all schools had a PTA.
 We further find that

 percent of households state the primary or secondary school attended by
 any of their children had a SMC.
 However, not all households were informed about SMC meetings.
 The baraza intervention did not seem to affect how schools were managed,
 how parents could participate, or how information was shared.
 Again, statistical power may be an issue in many of these comparisons,
 as illustrated by the large MDEs [placeholder for link to online repository

 find that in the early nineties, schools in Uganda received only about
 13 percent of central capitation grants to cover non-wage expenses.
 While the situation likely improved over the years, elite capture of funds
 at intermediate levels remains a problem.
 We look at heterogeneity related baseline levels of elite capture, proxied
 by the share of the budget that was reportedly received in the year prior
 to baseline data collection.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Based on data we collected from government officials in all sub-counties,
 we estimate the average shares of the health, agriculture and education
 sector budgets that was not received.
 We find that, overall, only about three quarters of the budget was disbursed.
 The situation was worse in the agricultural sector, where on average 38
 percent of the budget was not received.
 In the education sector and in the health sector, disbursement rates are
 the same at 82 percent.
 For the analysis, we define an indicator variable that takes the value
 of one if the household lives in a sub-county for which overall disbursement
 was less than 85 percent and interact this variable with the treatment
 indicator.
 Coefficients of this interaction term for regressions using indices are
 reported in Figure

We find that the information component of sub-county level baraza increases
 overall service delivery in areas characterized by relatively high levels
 of elite capture.
 For the agricultural sector, we find that the impact of sub-county level
 baraza we found in Figure 3 of the article is not subject to heterogeneity.
 However, we find that the information component of sub-county level barazas
 becomes significant in areas characterized by lower disbursement rates.
 For infrastructure, we do not find significant interaction effects, although
 all coefficients are estimated positive.
 The information component is also particularly effective in increasing
 public health service delivery in areas characterized by high levels of
 elite capture.
 For the education sector, estimated coefficients are also generally positive,
 but not significant.
 Overall, we conclude that barazas are more effective when elite capture
 is a problem.
 Especially the sharing of information at the events seems to elicit a response.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Heterogeneity related to connections to persons in power
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Related to the previous, we suspect that connections to people in power
 can make barazas more effective.
 There are several reasons why this is the case.
 For instance, barazas attract a lot of attention, and politicians that
 hail from a sub-county where a baraza was held may face greater electoral
 punishment if they are not sensitive to the issues raised.
 Connections to people in powerful positions may make it easier to direct
 money from the center to the district or sub-county to respond to some
 of the concerns raised during baraza events.
 Figure

 thus reports interaction effects of the different interventions with an
 indicator for sub-counties where officials report if the sub-county has
 residents that occupy leadership positions such as minister, member of

 parliament, heads of government agencies, Resident District Commissioners
 (RDCs), and other district level officials.

We do not find significant interaction effects based on the indices.
 However, coefficients are generally positive, especially for interactions
 with the deliberation focused sub-county baraza and district level barazas.
 Examples of positive interaction effects for individual outcomes reported

 include an increased likelihood of visiting extension offices, demonstration
 sites or model farmers and an increase in the likelihood that schools have
 a fence after a deliberation focused baraza.
 We also find a reduction in the use of unprotected water sources after
 a sub-county level baraza.

Adherence to Principles and Guidance for Human Subjects Research
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

We took great care in assuring that we always respected autonomy of research
 subjects (citizens, politicians and civil servants), protected them from
 harm, ensured their privacy, and treated them fairly.
 Research protocols and all tools such as consent forms and survey instruments
 were cleared by the Uganda National Council for Science and Technology,
 Makerere University School of Social Sciences Research Ethics Committee,
 as well as our institution's Institutional Review Board.
 All researchers involved in the study completed a course in ethics in Social
 & Behavioral Research organized by the Collaborative Institutional Training
 Initiative (CITI program).
 Below we discuss three points related to research ethics that are of particular
 relevance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Informed consent
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The study took the form of a cluster randomized control trial, where barazas
 were organized in randomly selected areas.
 The main identification strategy was to compare outcomes at the household
 level between households that were exposed to a baraza to households that
 were not exposed to a baraza.
 It is important to realize that being exposed to a baraza does not automaticall
y mean that the household also participated in the baraza event.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Households were sampled in both treatment and control clusters (sub-counties).
 These sampled households were surveyed before the intervention was rolled
 out to collect baseline information.
 Treatment status was not revealed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Household heads that were sampled were not told that the study was about
 the baraza project.
 Rather, we provided a general introduction, explaining that the objective
 of the study is to: understand what public services are accessible to household
s in rural areas, to understand the constraints households face, and to
 learn how government can improve the services they deliver.
 We also say that households do not derive direct benefit from the study
 (apart from a small token of gratitude which consisted of 2 bars of soap),
 but that our study may lead to indirect benefits if government implements
 recommendations derived from study findings.
 We explicitly inform the interviewee that participation in this study is
 voluntary and that they may choose to discontinue the interview at any
 time or skip any questions that make them uncomfortable (and they would
 still get the token of gratitude).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

We also explicitly assured participants that all information will always
 be kept confidential and that answers will be used only in the form of
 averages collected across the country to gauge public service delivery
 in Uganda, such that individual responses cannot be traced back to respondents.
 We also say that the information will not be used in any way other than
 for the purpose of conducting research on improving access to public services.
 We give an estimate of the time the interview will take and proved contact
 details of local research staff, the Principal Investigator and Institutional
 Review Board (IRB) for more information.
 We then ask for consent in writing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Endline data collection was organized in a similar way.
 The endline survey did have a module all the way at the end that inquired
 about participation in baraza events.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Potential risk to participants.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It may be argued that there are potential risks related to participating
 in a baraza event.
 Officials may retaliate against citizens that were very critical during
 baraza events.
 Power relations between politicians and civil servants may also lead to
 particular risk when performance is scrutinized during a baraza event.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, our study is unlikely to increase these risks that were already
 present as we are investigating an ongoing policy intervention.
 In particular, we do not coerce people into going to baraza events.
 Citizens are free to go to meetings and speak up if they feel comfortable.
 Politicians and civil servants, as office-bearers, are assumed to be accountabl
e for their actions to citizens.
 Our study does not add additional risk to the risk already present as a
 result of the ongoing baraza program.
 We also do not think the distinction between information and deliberation
 components leads to increased risk, as both are derived from the existing
 intervention.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As such, while we do agree that there are potential risks related to the
 intervention as implemented by the government of Uganda, we think these
 risks are reasonable.
 Citizens can manage the amount of risk they expose themselves to.

 For politicians and civil servants, the risks are part of the job and should
 be known to them in advance.
 More importantly, our study is passive in that it investigates on ongoing
 policy intervention.
 In other words, our study does not add to the risk already present.
 Therefore, we adhere to the principle of

Nature of the partnership with OPM:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

For this study, we partnered with the OPM as the implementer of a program
 to increase transparency and accountability in public service delivery.
 We were connected to OPM through a call by the International Initiative
 for Impact Evaluations (3ie).
 3ie was looking for an independent evaluator with a solid reputation for
 the ongoing policy program to increase public service delivery though community
-based monitoring.
 The evaluations would help identify what works best and what can be improved
 upon.
 Demonstrated impact could help OPM to secure more funding.
 The impact evaluation was funded by 3ie.
 This included funding for the surveys and some funding of researcher time.
 OPM did not directly receive funding from 3ie.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The assignment of treatment and control areas was done by us in a randomized
 way as explained in detail in the manuscript.
 The list was handed over to the persons responsible for rolling out the
 intervention at OPM.
 We explained the importance of randomization and it was agreed that the
 list would be followed for subsequent barazas.
 During the roll-out, we were in close contact with the person responsible
 for planning to makes sure OPM adhered to the list.

We also agreed on adapting the design to differentiate between an information
 focused baraza and a deliberation focused baraza.

 to make sure research protocols were followed.
